An undersea volcano about 300 miles (480 km) off Oregon's coast has been spewing lava for the past seven days, confirming forecasts made last fall and giving researchers unique insight into a hidden ocean hot spot, a scientist said on Friday.

Researchers know of two previous eruptions by the volcano, dubbed "Axial Seamount" for its location along the axis of an underwater mountain ridge, Oregon State University geologist Bill Chadwick said on Friday. But those 1998 and 2011 eruptions were detected months or years afterward, Chadwick added.

Last year, researchers connected monitoring gear to an undersea cable that, for the first time, allowed them to gather live data on the volcano, whose peak is about 4,900 feet (1,500 meters) below the ocean surface.

"The cable allows us to have more sensors and monitoring instruments than ever before, and it's happening in real time," said Chadwick, who also is affiliated with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In the past, researchers left battery-operated monitoring stations in place for several years, but were able to analyze the data only by retrieving those devices.

Pressure sensors detected that an eruption was underway on April 23. After monitoring hundreds then thousands of small earthquakes each day near Axial Seamount, they detected more than 8,000 tiny quakes over a 24-hour span on April 23, Chadwick said.

As midnight approached, pressure sensors detected the seafloor dropping - a sign that magma was erupting - and the swollen volcano was deflating like an emptying balloon. In total, the seafloor has dropped 8 feet (2.4 meters) in the past week.

Though the eruption has slowed, the volcano still seemed to be expelling magma as of Friday, he said, leaving Chadwick and scientists working with him wondering where the lava was going.

"We know it didn't erupt in the caldera, or crater, because that's where most of our sensors are, and they all survived," Chadwick said. 

Temperature fluctuations and seismic readings are consistent with an eruption north of the volcano's crater, he said. "But we probably won't know until this summer, when we get out there with a ship and are able to look around."

It may not be space debris, errant asteroids, supply shortages, thruster malfunctions or even the malevolent aliens envisioned in so many Hollywood films that thwart astronauts on any mission to Mars. It may be the ubiquitous galactic cosmic rays.

Researchers said on Friday long-term exposure to these rays that permeate space may cause dementia-like cognitive impairments in astronauts during any future round-trip Mars journey, expected to take at least 2-1/2 years.

In a NASA-funded study, mice exposed to highly energetic charged particles like those in galactic cosmic rays experienced declines in cognition and changes in the structure and integrity of brain nerve cells and the synapses where nerve impulses are sent and received.

The irradiated particles in galactic cosmic rays, remnants of star explosions called supernovas, can penetrate spacecraft and astronauts' bodies. Earth itself is protected by its magnetosphere.

University of California, Irvine radiation oncology professor Charles Limoli said "without a doubt" people would face the same issues as the mice.

"Astronauts may incur cognitive impairments that lead to performance decrements, confusion, increased anxiety and longer-term problems with cognitive health," said Limoli, whose study appears in the journal Science Advances.

This could compromise mission critical activities, especially if unanticipated situations arise during deep spaceflight, Limoli said.

The mice, genetically altered to have green fluorescent neurons to help structural analysis, were exposed to the rays at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and then analyzed six weeks later.

In addition to the brain neuron and synapse changes, the mice exhibited decreased performance on learning and memory tests. They also lacked curiosity and were sluggish in experiments involving objects placed in a box with them.

"Previous studies show synaptic impairment or loss of synapses is an early and invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease, and there is a strong correlation between the extent of synapse loss and the severity of dementia," said University of California, Irvine neuroscientist Vipan Kumar Parihar.

NASA says it is developing the capabilities needed to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and Mars in the 2030s.

NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said a Mars mission would take at least 2-1/2 years: a six-month journey there, a stay on Mars of at least 18 months, and a six-month flight back. 

Limoli said while Mars-bound astronauts cannot fully escape the rays, it may be possible to design spacecraft with areas of increased protective shielding.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it would ask the operators of Boeing Co's model 787 airplanes to deactivate the plane's electrical power system periodically.

The FAA said the new airworthiness directive was prompted by the determination that power control units on a model 787 airplane could shut down power generators if they are powered continuously for 248 days.

Sudden loss of power could result in the aircraft going out of control, the directive noted.

Boeing is developing a software upgrade to counter the problem. FAA estimates that this directive affects 28 airplanes of U.S. registry.

In November last year, the FAA had proposed a fix for the 787 model after "numerous reports of failures of proximity sensors" on the plane's wings.

Boeing delivered 30 of its 787 planes worldwide in the first quarter of 2015.

Blue Origin, a startup space company owned by Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos, launched an experimental suborbital spaceship from Texas, the first in a series of test flights to develop commercial unmanned and passenger spaceflight services, the company said on Thursday.

The New Shepard vehicle blasted off on Wednesday from Blue Origin’s test facility near Van Horn, Texas, and rose to an altitude of 58 miles (93 km) before the capsule separated and parachuted back to Earth.

“Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,” Bezos said in a statement.

The descent of the liquid hydrogen- and liquid oxygen-fueled rocket, however, was not successful.

“We lost pressure in our hydraulic system on descent,” Bezos noted. “Fortunately, we’ve already been in work for some time on an improved hydraulic system ... We’ll be ready to fly again soon."

Blue Origin is among a handful of companies developing privately owned spaceships to fly experiments, satellites and passengers into space. Like Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of Richard Branson’s London-based Virgin Group, and privately owned XCOR Aerospace, Blue Origin is eyeing suborbital spaceflights, which reach altitudes of about 62 miles (100 km), as a stepping stone to orbital flight.

Virgin Galactic plans to resume test flights of its six-passenger, two-pilot SpaceShipTwo vehicle later this year, following a fatal accident in October. Mojave, Calif.-based XCOR plans to begin test flights of its two-person Lynx space plane in late 2015 as well.

Boeing and privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, both of which have financial support from NASA, are skipping suborbital flight and building space taxis to ferry crews to and from the International Space Station, which flies about 250 miles (418 km) above Earth.

Blue Origin also is working on a more powerful, methane-burning rocket engine that has attracted the backing of United Launch Alliance, the Lockheed-Martin/Boeing partnership that currently flies nearly all of the U.S. military’s satellites.

Blue Origin, SpaceX and United Launch Alliance are all developing reusable launch systems in an effort to cut costs.

Blue Origin expects to fly New Shepard dozens of times unmanned before test pilots are aboard, company President Rob Meyerson told reporters during an April 7 conference call. The capsule is designed to fly three people and/or a mix of passengers and payloads to suborbital space. Blue Origin has not yet released pricing information.

NASA's pioneering Messenger spacecraft ended its four-year study of the planet Mercury on Thursday by crashing into the planet’s surface, scientists said.

Flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland earlier estimated that Messenger, traveling at more than 8,700 mph (14,000 kph), would hit the ground near Mercury’s north pole at 3:26 p.m. EDT (1926 GMT).

Messenger, with no more fuel to maneuver, fought the downward push of the sun's gravity until it impacted the planet's surface. It likely gouged a 52-foot-wide (16 meter) crater into Mercury's 's scarred face

During its final weeks in orbit, Messenger relayed more details about the innermost planet of the solar system, which turns out to have patches of ice inside some of its craters, despite its sizzling location more than twice as close to the sun as Earth.

"We've been concentrating on getting as much of the data down on the ground,” lead researcher Sean Solomon, with Columbia University in New York, wrote in an email. “We will have years to think about the meaning of the measurements.”

Messenger, or the Mercury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging craft, made the first close-up studies of Mercury since NASA’s Mariner 10 spacecraft flew by the planet three times in the mid-1970s. It arrived at Mercury in 2011 after a circuitous six-year journey.

During its 4,104 orbits of Mercury, Messenger made surprising detections of potassium, sulfur and other volatiles on the planet’s surface that presumably should have evaporated due to the planet’s high temperature. Mercury’s average surface temperature is 332 degrees Fahrenheit (167 degrees Celsius), with daytime highs of 801 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius.)

Messenger also confirmed the existence of ices and other materials, possibly even carbon-based organics, on the floors of craters where sunlight never shines. During its final days, Messenger attempted to peer directly down into targeted craters, Solomon said.

It also found evidence of past volcanic activity and signs the dense and shrinking planet has a liquid-iron core.

"It's mind-boggling how much we have accomplished,” Messenger scientist Deborah Domingue, with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said in a statement. “There is such a feeling of satisfaction."

Europe and Japan are partnering on a follow-on mission to Mercury, called BepiColombo, due to launch in 2017.

NASA’s Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft has spotted surface features on the icy world, including a possible polar cap, images released on Wednesday show.

With 60 million miles (97 million km) left to go before its July 14, 2015, encounter, New Horizons already has been able to make out surprising light and dark patches on the surface of Pluto, which is currently more than 32 times farther away from Earth than the sun.

“We are starting to see intriguing features, such as a bright region near Pluto’s visible pole,” NASA science chief John Grunsfeld said in a statement, in reference to what scientists believe could be a polar ice cap.

In the images, Pluto appears as a small, highly pixelated blob, but already scientists can see there is something very odd about its surface. “It’s rare to see any planet in the solar system, at this low resolution, displaying such strong surface markings. If you had similar images of Mercury, or images of even Mars, you would not see the same kinds of big surface units going by as you do here on Pluto. That’s very promising,” New Horizons lead scientist Alan Stern, with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., told reporters during a conference call. Because Pluto is tipped onto its side, similar to Uranus, New Horizons has a steady gaze on one of its polar regions, which appears in the images to be consistently brighter than other areas. Scientists suspect the pole is covered by a highly reflective cap of nitrogen ice.

New Horizons has been traveling toward Pluto for 9.5 years. In the interim, Pluto, which was once considered the ninth and outermost planet in the solar system, was demoted to “dwarf planet” status after scientists discovered other similar icy bodies in solar system’s back yard.

As scientists prepare for their first close-up views of Pluto, another mission at the innermost planet is coming to an end. Out of fuel after four years in orbit, NASA’s Messenger spacecraft is expected to make a crash landing into Mercury on Thursday.

The mouse walked, the mouse stopped; the mouse ignored a bowl of food, then scampered back and gobbled it up, and it was all controlled by neuroscientists, researchers reported on Thursday.

The study, describing a way to manipulate a lab animal's brain circuitry accurately enough to turn behaviors both on and off, is the first to be published under President Barack Obama's 2013 BRAIN Initiative, which aims to advance neuroscience and develop therapies for brain disorders.

The point of the remote-control mouse is not to create an army of robo-rodents. Instead, neuroscientists hope to perfect a technique for identifying brain wiring underlying any behavior, and control that behavior by activating and deactivating neurons.

If scientists are able do that for the circuitry involved in psychiatric or neurological disorders, it may lead to therapies. That approach reflects a shift away from linking such illnesses to "chemical imbalances" in the brain, instead tracing them to miswiring and misfiring in neuronal circuits.

"This tool sharpens the cutting edge of research aimed at improving our understanding of brain circuit disorders, such as schizophrenia and addictive behaviors," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the $1 million study.

The technique used to control neurons is called DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs).

Brain neurons are genetically engineered to produce a custom-made - "designer" - receptor. When the receptor gathers in a manmade molecule that fits like a key in a lock, the neuron is activated.

Because the receptor does not respond to other molecules, including natural ones in the brain, the only way to activate the neurons is via the manmade one. DREADDs allow scientists to manipulate neurons without implanting anything in the brain.

DREADDs, invented about a decade ago, had been used to turn neurons on or off, but not both. DREADDs 2.0 are the first to do that, scientists led by Bryan Roth of the University of North Carolina reported in Neuron.

Targeting hunger-promoting neurons, the scientists made mice ignore food bowls or dive into them. Targeting movement neurons, they made mice scamper or stop.

In a competing remote-control technique called optogenetics, engineered neurons are activated upon receiving a pulse of light. That turns them on and off more quickly than with DREADDs, but the hardware required for delivering light to a spot in the brain is invasive and cumbersome.

The U.S. Air Force on Wednesday said it plans to launch an aging weather satellite at an expected cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent a gap in forecasting capability and provide another competitive launch opportunity for privately held Space Exploration Technologies Inc, or SpaceX.

General John Hyten, who heads Air Force Space Command, and Air Force Secretary Deborah James, said a decision had been made to launch the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Flight 20 satellite, which was built in the 1990s.

James told the strategic forces subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Air Force had little choice but to launch the satellite after European allies reversed a decision to launch a weather satellite of their own.

"We have a gap. We have to take care of ourselves," James told the subcommittee.

Hyten said it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to store and launch the satellite, but the decision would allow the U.S. military to "plug some gaps" in its forecasting capability.

The Air Force recently added new sensors to DMSP F-20 and DMSP F-19, which was launched last April. The DMSP constellation of satellites has been providing weather data to the Pentagon since the 1960s.

The Defense Department, NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched a joint weather satellite program in the 2000s, but the program was revamped and broken up into separate parts after cost overruns and schedule delays.

Hyten said the decision would also give SpaceX another chance to compete against the current monopoly launcher, the United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.

No further details were immediately available about the exact cost, or when the satellite would be launched.

The Air Force has said it expects to certify SpaceX to compete to launch U.S. military and intelligence satellites by June. It could cost extra time and money to modify the satellite to fly on SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

In March, Space News quoted Colonel Michael Guetlein, commander of the the remote sensing systems directorate at Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, as saying the Air Force could launch the weather satellite in 2016.

Hyten said James had also decided last week to proceed with a weather satellite that could be launched very quickly under the Air Force's Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) office.

Anytime, day or night, no matter which way you look, it seems you'll see someone with a smartphone in their hand.

Jesse Robbins and Greg Albrecht of San Francisco based company Orion wanted to find a way to give people their hands back. 

"What can I do to make real time communication something that everyone in the world can have in a way that doesn't have them looking down at their smartphone," said Robbins, who learned the importance of hands-free communication during his days as a volunteer firefighter.  

Robbins began sharing his ideas with fellow firefighter Greg Albrecht, a communications and IP specialist. 

"We wanted something you could wear that would keep you in the moment and keep you in what you were doing," added Albrecht.  

The answer to their search came in the form of a wearable device called Onyx that allows you to communicate with people anywhere in the world while keeping your phone in your pocket. 

The device is the main mode of communication at the company's large office space in the Mission District of San Francisco.    

There are plenty of hands free options in the market, but armed with a team of coders and developers, Orion took their concept a step further. 

"It is essentially a bluetooth communications device so it is not much different than any other bluetooth device you might connect to your phone with the exception that the Onyx and other devices on the Orion network connect you to the Orion network," said Albrecht. 

The Orion network, accessed via an app on your phone, is what sets the company apart. It allows any member, no matter their location or cellular provider to speak with another member or group of members with a simple push of a button.   

"The range is the Internet. It has even been used on a moving boat in Palao to talk to a team back in the United States," said Robbins. 

The network also provides users with other useful information about their contacts location and their online status. 

Robbins envisions a day when the devices get smaller and the capabilities of the network expand, giving users the ability to control everything from their TV to their appliances with voice commands. 

The company is growing and will offer a new device called Ruby marketed towards the fashion conscious later this year.

Scientists in China on Wednesday described one of the weirdest flying creatures ever discovered, a pigeon-size dinosaur with wings like a bat that lived not long before the first birds.

The dinosaur, named Yi qi (meaning "strange wing" in Mandarin and pronounced EE-chee), lived about 160 million years during the Jurassic Period, about 10 million years before the earliest-known bird, Archaeopteryx.

It is considered a cousin of birds, but boasted membranous wings made of skin like those of the extinct flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, which lived at the same time, and bats, which appeared more than 100 million years later, instead of the stiff, plume-like feathers of birds.

Each wing was supported by a clawed, three-fingered hand and a rod-like bone extending from the wrist. One of the fingers was much longer than the others. Feathers preserved around its head, neck and limbs are more similar to hairs or bristles than to bird flight feathers.

"It's hard to imagine that it could have flapped very effectively, since the rod-like bone was presumably a fairly unwieldy thing to have attached to the wrist," said paleontologist Corwin Sullivan of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.

"So our guess would be that Yi qi was gliding or maybe combining gliding with some relatively inefficient flapping."

Before aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright flew the world's first successful airplane, others dabbled with all manner of experimental flying machines. There was an analogous period of flight experimentation among dinosaurs before small feathered ones evolved into birds.

Finding a dinosaur with membranous wings was "quite amazing and unexpected," Sullivan said. "Yi qi illustrates the flight-related evolutionary tinkering that was going on in the dinosaur precursors to birds."

Patches of the membranous wing tissue were preserved in the fossil discovered in Hebei Province by a local farmer, but the overall wing shape remains uncertain.

The dinosaur probably lived in trees and used peg-like teeth to munch lizards, mammals and insects, and perhaps fruit.

"This guy is not far from the first birds, in fact," said paleontologist Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Linyi University. "It belongs to a bizarre dinosaur group called the scansoriopterygids, which are closely related to the most primitive birds such as Archaeopteryx."

Yi qi is the shortest name of any of the more than 700 identified dinosaur species.

The research appears in the journal Nature.

Russia has abandoned a 2.6 billion ruble ($51 million) mission to supply the International Space Station, the head of the Roscosmos space agency said on Wednesday, the latest setback for the country's beleaguered space program.

The unmanned Progress M-27M cargo ship, carrying almost 3 tonnes (2,722 kg) of supplies, was unable to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) because of problems after it launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan early on Tuesday, said Roscosmos head Igor Komarov.

Komarov listed a series of technical problems that caused the freighter to tumble out of control shortly after it reached its preliminary orbit.

"Because of this, the craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible," he told a news conference.

Space exploration is a subject of national pride in Russia, rooted in the Cold War "space race" with the United States, but the collapse of the Soviet Union starved the space program of funds and it has been beset by problems in recent years.

Industrial disputes and accusations of corruption have plagued the construction of the flagship Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia's far east and Roscosmos announced last week it was cutting spending by more than a third over the next 10 years because of the country's economic crisis.

WRECKAGE UNLIKELY TO REACH EARTH

The total cost of Progress cargo ship and its booster rocket was 2.59 billion roubles, a Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters.

Launch dates for two more Progress cargo ships will be delayed until the third and fourth quarter of this year, said Roscosmos deputy-head Alexander Ivanov.

Wreckage from the doomed Progress M-27M ship is likely to burn up as it re-enters the atmosphere, said Vladimir Solovyev, flight director for the Russian section of the ISS.

"(The descent trajectory) indicates that the structural elements of the ship will not reach the Earth's surface," he said.

Any surviving debris will probably land between May 5-7 but experts will not know exactly where it will fall for at least another two days, Solovyev added.

The Progress ship is currently orbiting approximately 123 miles (197 km) above earth, according to satellite tracking website n2yo.com. NASA told Reuters in an email it did not know when the Progress capsule would re-enter the atmosphere.

The current crew on the International Space Station comprises Americans Terry Virts and Scott Kelly, Russians Anton Shkaplerov, Gennady Padalka and Mikhail Korniyenko, and Italian Samantha Cristoforetti.

Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room.

Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body.

"Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else," said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL).

Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body.

The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects.

Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling.

"We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment," said Blanke.

The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up "sensorimotor" brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances.

The study, published in Current Biology, said that "simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia".

Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations.

"We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients."

Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab.

"A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state."

Hanbyul Joo is working on his swing. But he's not at a baseball park, instead he's in a massive geodesic dome in the basement of a building at Carnegie Mellon University. As Joo swings, more than 500 cameras capture his motion on video.  Combined and processed, those videos make up the elements for the most advanced 3D reconstruction ever achieved.

The two story dome is called the Panoptic Studio and its made up of 20 panels, each of which houses 24 cameras. That coupled with an additional 30 HD cameras and depth sensors add up to ensure that the system can capture more than 100,000 different points of motion at any given moment.  

"One minute of videos is about 500 gigabytes which is really huge data. To handle that data we are using 120 hard drives only for the capture," said Hanbyul Joo, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States. 

Thousands of cables snake around the dome feeding the video singles to a bank of computers that store the data. After the video is captured, it's processed using algorithms which allow the scientists to turn what are essentially 500 different video feeds into a pinpoint accurate 3D reconstruction.

According to Joo, these reconstructions have a wide range of applications, the most evident being in sports where the ability to analyze and correct even the smallest motions could mean the difference between a good kick and a perfect one.     

"The main purpose of this system is to analyze very interesting dynamic movements or dynamics things such as a sports players' motion," said Joo. "Using our system we can compare those movements so we can see how to teach the right motion to people," he added. 

But even more exciting is the technology's potential in the fields of social and behavioral science. The studio's ability to capture even the most subtle movements could one day allow doctors to screen for early signs of diseases ranging from dementia to autism.

The researchers are also looking to take their technology outside the lab. Joo says that, in principle, the same algorithms can be used to generate 3D reconstructions of concerts and sporting events using the media produced by thousands of people snapping selfies and making videos.

Russia was forced to postpone the docking of an unmanned cargo ship with the International Space Station on Tuesday because of a problem receiving data from the supply craft.

The Progress M-27M should have docked with the orbiting station about six hours after its launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan early on Tuesday but the Roscosmos space agency said it now expected a delay of at least two days.

"There are some problems with the data telemetry. They are being worked on by Roscosmos specialists," it said in a statement that gave few details.

TASS news agency quoted an unnamed space official as saying the Progress, carrying supplies such as food and fuel, had missed its intended orbit and could be lost if it is not corrected. Other officials told Russian news agencies there had been a problem opening two antennae on the craft.

Space exploration is a subject of national pride in Russia, rooted in the Cold War "space race" with the United States, but the collapse of the Soviet Union starved the space program of funds and it has been beset by problems in recent years.

An unmanned SpaceX rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Monday to put a communications satellite into orbit for the government of Turkmenistan, a first for the Central Asian nation.

After waiting almost an hour for cloudy skies to clear, the 22-story Falcon 9 rocket bolted off its seaside launch pad at 7:03 p.m. (2303 GMT).

Perched on top of the rocket was a Spacebus 4000 telecommunications satellite, built by Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture of Thales SA and Finmeccanica SpA.

Once in orbit, the five-ton (4,500-kg) satellite, known as TurkmenAlem52E, will become Turkmenistan’s first telecommunications spacecraft, relaying television broadcasts and other services to more than 1.2 billion people in Central Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, according to Thales Alenia Space.

“The launch is a vital first step in Turkmenistan’s development as a space nation,” Jean Loic Galle, president and chief executive of Thales Alenia Space, said in a SpaceX webcast video before launch.

From its perch 22,300 miles above Earth, the satellite, designed to last 15 years, will be located in a slot controlled by Monaco. In exchange for letting Turkmenistan operate there, Monaco’s satellite operator, Space Systems International, has use of 12 of the spacecraft’s Ku-band transponders.

Monday’s launch was the 18th for Space Exploration Technologies, the privately owned, California-based company known as SpaceX, and its second in less than two weeks.

SpaceX has been experimenting with landing the rockets on an ocean barge, but skipped the test after Monday’s launch because the rocket needed all its fuel to properly position TurkmenAlem52E into its initial orbit.

Landing attempts are expected to resume in June when SpaceX launches its next cargo ship to the International Space Station, which flies about 250 miles (418 km) above Earth.

This is a video of a lateral line, an organ that allows fish to sense water movement, developing in a zebra fish.

Using an imaging technique called Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy, which uses sheets of lights to illuminate sub-cellular activity, Dr. Mariana Muzzopappa and Jim Swoger from the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona Spain, claimed top honors in this year's Nikon Small World in Motion Photomicrography Competition.

The entry was one of hundreds submitted for the contest, which aims to highlight the latest techniques of scientific imaging.

Second place went to Dr. Douglas Clark from San Francisco, California who used polarized light to create a time-lapse movie showing crystals forming on a single drop of a solution saturated with caffeine in water. Clark's time-lapse condenses 20 minutes of crystallization into 40 seconds.

Third place honors went to Dr. John Hart from the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Colorado-Boulder for a detailed look at oil floating on the surface of water. The video shows pools of water a fraction of the size of a human hair slowly evaporating, as the oil form into larger droplets. This microscopic view of the fluid dynamics involved when oil and water meet could offer researchers clues on how better to deal with future oil spills.

An undersea volcano about 300 miles (480 km) off Oregon's coast has been spewing lava for the past seven days, confirming forecasts made last fall and giving researchers unique insight into a hidden ocean hot spot, a scientist said on Friday.

Researchers know of two previous eruptions by the volcano, dubbed "Axial Seamount" for its location along the axis of an underwater mountain ridge, Oregon State University geologist Bill Chadwick said on Friday. But those 1998 and 2011 eruptions were detected months or years afterward, Chadwick added.

Last year, researchers connected monitoring gear to an undersea cable that, for the first time, allowed them to gather live data on the volcano, whose peak is about 4,900 feet (1,500 meters) below the ocean surface.

"The cable allows us to have more sensors and monitoring instruments than ever before, and it's happening in real time," said Chadwick, who also is affiliated with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In the past, researchers left battery-operated monitoring stations in place for several years, but were able to analyze the data only by retrieving those devices.

Pressure sensors detected that an eruption was underway on April 23. After monitoring hundreds then thousands of small earthquakes each day near Axial Seamount, they detected more than 8,000 tiny quakes over a 24-hour span on April 23, Chadwick said.

As midnight approached, pressure sensors detected the seafloor dropping - a sign that magma was erupting - and the swollen volcano was deflating like an emptying balloon. In total, the seafloor has dropped 8 feet (2.4 meters) in the past week.

Though the eruption has slowed, the volcano still seemed to be expelling magma as of Friday, he said, leaving Chadwick and scientists working with him wondering where the lava was going.

"We know it didn't erupt in the caldera, or crater, because that's where most of our sensors are, and they all survived," Chadwick said. 

Temperature fluctuations and seismic readings are consistent with an eruption north of the volcano's crater, he said. "But we probably won't know until this summer, when we get out there with a ship and are able to look around."

A batch of straw houses have gone on sale in the UK - and their manufacturers insist that unlike the home featured in classic nursery rhyme The Three Little Pigs, huffing and puffing will not lead the buildings to blow down.

In fact, the architect of the scheme, Professor Pete Walker of the University of Bath, says that using straw in home construction isn't just viable, but safer than other traditional building materials, and will lead to vastly reduced energy bills for inhabitants.

Seven of the homes have been built in the west country town of Shirehampton, and cost a similar amount to a traditional red-brick house to construct. According to Walker, "you can see that the building is clad in red brick but underneath that are the straw bales which form this super-insulated wall construction, whereas the houses around here are largely brick cavity construction. So the innovation really has laid in developing the suitability of straw as a construction material and also convincing people that straw is a viable construction material. People often refer to the nursery rhyme of the Three Little Pigs, and as a result I think people need convincing that straw is robust, safe, durable, and a modern construction material."    

Walker says that straw is used in two different ways in the construction. "In this particular building straw has been used in two ways. First of all it's used as straw bales, so the bales come directly from the farmer from wheat straw, and that is in the outside of the walls, so it's there as installation behind the brick walls, and then inside compressed straw panels are being used as lining panels and as dividers to separate the rooms as well," he said.

The 3.2 metre by 2.9 metre ModCell straw panels consist of an engineered timber frame which enclose the compressed straw bale insulation. The load-bearing straw panels are constructed within an airtight design, in conjunction with triple glazed windows. According to Walker, the straw walls provide three times' greater insulation than required by current UK building regulations, so fuel bills should fall by up to 90 per cent.

The homes were built by Bristol-based company ModCell, in conjunction with Walker's team at the University of Bath's Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering. The university department has been developing the technology for around 15 years, initially building a prefabricated straw bale building on campus called the BaleHaus as a test site in 2009.

Walker says using straw has other positive environmental benefits, utilising some of Britain's seven million tonnes of straw remains left after the production of wheat flour, around half of which is discarded due to its low value. This leftover straw could be used to build more than 500,000 new homes, as an average three-bedroom house needs 7.2 tonnes of straw. Straw also absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2), rather than releasing it, as happens with brick and cement.

"We're not displacing food crops to grow, (as) in the case where the materials have been used to grow biofuels," said Walker. "We already grow wheat because we need it for bread and for other uses, so we're just using a material that's already available on the market. And as a plant, through photosynthesis, it actually absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and that carbon dioxide is effectively stored within the straw. So it comes in the form of a carbon sink, so it's carbon storage within the fabric of the building and so the more straw you use the more carbon you store within your building for the life of the building."

ModCell straw panels have also, perhaps counter-intuitively, proved particularly resistant to fire. "They passed the fire resistance requirements more than satisfactorily," said Walker. "The panels here which are not lined with lime render had a fire resistance of about 52 minutes and they need fire resistance of 30 minutes for use in housing. But one panel that we used, which was rendered with lime, onto the straw actually had a fire resistance of two hours and fifteen minutes before we stopped the test. So in fact it's remarkably resistant to fire."

The seven homes were put up for sale by Bristol social housing firm Connolly and Callaghan, at £220,000 (330,000 USD) for two bedroom houses and £235,000 (250,000 USD) for four bedroom ones. The four-bedroom have been oversubscribed. Connolly and Callaghan hope to build a further 49 more straw homes nearby.

A Space Exploration Technologies' passenger spaceship made a quick debut test flight on Wednesday, shooting itself off a Florida launch pad to demonstrate a key emergency escape system.

The 20 foot- (6 meter) tall Dragon capsule, a modified version of the spacecraft that flies cargo to the International Space Station, fired up its eight, side-mounted thruster engines at 9 a.m. EDT to catapult nearly one mile (1.6 km) up and over the Atlantic Ocean.

The flight ended less than two minutes later with the capsule's parachute splash-down about 1.4 miles (2.6 km) east of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch site.

“I think this bodes quite well for the future of the program,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk told reporters on a conference call after the flight. “It was quite a complicated test.”

The purpose of the flight was to demonstrate an escape system to carry the capsule to safety in case of a fire or accident during launch.

"It’s kind of like an ejection seat in an airplane. You have the ability to leave the pad sitting in the capsule and the capsule would come off and land," NASA astronaut Eric Boe said during an interview on NASA TV.

"It's one of the things the shuttle didn't have," added Boe, who twice flew as a space shuttle pilot.

NASA retired the shuttles in 2011 and invested in commercial designs for a new generation of space taxis. The U.S. space agency has contracts worth a combined $6.8 billion with privately owned SpaceX, as the California-based firm is known, and Boeing for spaceship development and up to six flights per company.

NASA hopes to be flying astronauts to the space station on U.S. spaceships by December 2017, breaking Russia’s monopoly on crew ferry flights. NASA currently pays Russia about $63 million per person for rides on its Soyuz capsules.

No astronauts were aboard the heavily instrumented Dragon capsule that flew Wednesday, though a crash dummy was strapped into a seat in the crew cabin. Musk said the capsule reached a peak speed of 345 mph (555 kph).

“That’s pretty zippy,” he said.

SpaceX plans to refly the capsule as early as this summer aboard a Falcon 9 rocket to test an abort maneuver at supersonic speed and high altitude. The rocket will fly from SpaceX's launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and Norway, scientists have found microorganisms they call a missing link connecting the simple cells that first populated Earth to the complex cellular life that emerged roughly 2 billion years ago.

The researchers said on Wednesday a group of microorganisms called Lokiarchaeota, or Loki for short, were retrieved from the inhospitable, frigid seabed about 1.5 miles (2.35 km) under the ocean surface not too far from a hydrothermal vent system called Loki's Castle, named after a Norse mythological figure.

The discovery provides insight into how the larger, complex cell types that are the building blocks for fungi, plants and animals including people, a group called eukaryotes, evolved from small, simple microbes, they said.

The Lokiarchaeota are part of a group called Archaea that have relatively simple cells lacking internal structures such as a nucleus. But the researchers found the Lokiarchaeota share with eukaryotes a significant number of genes, many with functions related to the cell membrane.

These genes would have provided Lokiarchaeota "with a 'starter-kit' to support the development of cellular complexity," said evolutionary microbiologist Lionel Guy of Sweden's Uppsala University.

Archaea and bacteria, another microbial form, are together known as prokaryotes.

"Humans have always been interested in trying to find an answer to the question, 'Where do we come from?' Well, now we know from what type of microbial ancestor we descend," said Uppsala University evolutionary microbiologist Thijs Ettema, who coordinated the study.

"Essentially, Lokiarchaeota represent a missing piece of the puzzle of the evolution from simple cells - bacteria and archaea, prokaryotes - to complex cells - eukaryotes, which includes us humans," Ettema added.

Earth's wide diversity of life would have been impossible without this transition from rudimentary cells into the more complicated ones seen in multicellular life. Microbial life originated about 3.5 billion years ago. The first complex cellular life came roughly 2 billion years ago.

How cellular complexity first developed has been one of the big puzzles of evolutionary biology, Guy said.

The Lokiarchaeota were retrieved from oxygen-starved sediment layers during voyages of a Norwegian research vessel, said microbiologist Steffen Jørgensen of Norway's University of Bergen.

While the Loki's Castle geothermal vents spew fluids reaching about 570 degrees Fahrenheit (300 degrees Celsius) about 9 miles (15 km) away, the Lokiarchaeota's locale was desolate, pitch dark and around the freezing point, Jørgensen added.

The research appears in the journal Nature.

From ways to eavesdrop on brains and learn what advertisements excite consumers, to devices that alleviate depression, the number of U.S. patents awarded for "neurotechnology" has soared since 2010, according to an analysis released on Wednesday.

Most surprising, concluded market-research firm SharpBrains, is that patents have been awarded to inventors well beyond those at medical companies. The leader in neurotechnology patents, according to the report, is consumer-research behemoth Nielsen.

That expansion into non-medical uses, said SharpBrains Chief Executive Alvaro Fernandez, who presented the results at the NeuroGaming conference in San Francisco, shows we are at the dawn of "the pervasive neurotechnology age," in which everyday technologies will be connected to brains.

"Neurotech has gone well beyond medicine, with non-medical corporations, often under the radar, developing neurotechnologies to enhance work and life," he said.

Patents for neurotechnology bumped along at 300 to 400 a year in the 2000s, then soared to 800 in 2010 and 1,600 last year, SharpBrains reported.

Those awarded to medical device company Medtronic PLC, for instance, include ways to use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the severity of a brain lesion. Several held by medical technology company St. Jude Medical Inc. describe ways to change brain activity to, say, improve vision.

But it is the explosion in non-medical uses, such as controlling video games with brain waves, that is driving neurotechnology.

SharpBrains measured "intellectual property (IP) strength" by number of neurotechnology patents as well as patent quality, reflected in how many other patents reference them, for instance.

By that measure, Nielsen leads the pack, with patents describing ways to detect brain activity with EEG and translate it into what someone truly thinks about, say, a new product, advertising, or packaging.

Microsoft Corp. holds patents that assess mental states, with the goal of determining the most effective way to present information. If software knows a user's attention is wandering, it could hold back complicated material.

Another Microsoft patent describes a neuro-system that claims to discern whether a computer user is amenable to receiving advertisements.

Such patents reflect the enthusiasm for neuro-monitoring, something many scientists say has not been shown to be more effective than, say, asking people what they think about a product.

On a lighter note, an EEG patent awarded to San Jose-based biosensors company NeuroSky describes a design for a headset that could deliver music based on a user's brainwaves, perhaps a ballad when the listener is feeling contemplative.

An unmanned Russian spacecraft on a failed resupply run to the International Space Station is heading back toward Earth faster than original predictions, with a fiery demise in the atmosphere expected early on Friday, U.S. Air Force tracking data shows.

The Russian Progress capsule, loaded with more than three tons of food, fuel and supplies, blasted off aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on April 28.

Flight controllers lost contact with the freighter shortly after it reached orbit, and tracking radars later showed the capsule was tumbling. The cause of the accident is under investigation.

The Air Force’s Joint Space Operations Center, which tracks satellites and junk orbiting Earth, found 44 pieces of debris near the Progress and its discarded upper-stage booster, a possible indication that an explosion or other problem occurred just before or during spacecraft separation.

The Russian space agency Roscosmos declined to comment. Results of its preliminary investigation are expected on May 13.

Unable to raise its altitude, the Progress capsule is being pulled back toward Earth. On Wednesday, it was flying as low as 107 miles (173 km) above the planet, according to the satellite tracking website n2yo.com.

The Air Force’s contractor-operated Space-Track.org website shows the capsule due to plunge back into Earth’s atmosphere around 5 a.m. EDT Friday.

The capsule and cargo are expected to burn up in the atmosphere, with any surviving debris likely to impact in the ocean.

“Only a few small pieces of structural elements could reach the planet’s surface,” Roscosmos said in a statement.

The exact location where Progress will re-enter the atmosphere is not yet known. Earth’s atmosphere, which creates drag on a satellite, constantly expands and contracts due to solar activity and other factors.

Dozens of spacecraft larger than Progress have made safe though uncontrolled returns into Earth’s atmosphere, including the United States’ 152,000 pound (69,000 kg) Skylab space station in 1979 and Russia’s 29,800 pound (13,500 kg) failed Phobos-Grunt Mars probe in 2012.

A launch accident claimed another Russian Progress cargo ship in 2011. NASA contractor Orbital ATK lost a station cargo shipment during a botched launch last year. Privately owned Space Exploration Technologies and Japan also fly freighters to the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (418 km) above Earth.

When the fin whale gets ready to eat, Earth's second-largest animal opens its mouth so wide that it can gulp an amount of water larger than the volume of its own body as it filters out meals of tiny fish and shrimp-like krill.

When feeding, this whale measuring up to about 88 feet (26.8 meters) long and 70 tons increases its swimming speed, opens its mouth and lunges in the ocean.

The force of water rushing into the mouth during "lunge feeding" turns the tongue upside down and expands the bottom of the oral cavity into a huge pouch between the body wall and the overlying skin and blubber. As it closes its mouth, the whale filters out seawater through plates in the mouth while eating huge quantities of small prey.

In other animals and humans, this would cause significant damage to the nerves in the mouth and tongue, which have a fixed length.

But scientists revealed on Monday how the fin whale and its closest cousins, including the even-bigger blue whale, do this without shredding their nerves. These nerves, they said, can stretch to double their usual length and recoil like a bungee cord without harming the nerve fibers.

"Yes, this is way cool," said anatomist Wayne Vogl of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. "Not only do tissues in the floor of the mouth have to adjust to dramatic expansion and recoil, but all the 'plumbing and wiring' to the structures have to adjust as well, hence the stretchy nerves."

The researchers said this unusual nerve structure is present in rorqual whales, a group of filter-feeding baleen whales including the blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, sei whale, Omura's whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, common minke whale and Antarctic minke whale.

They discovered this feature while examining the carcass of a fin whale, an endangered species found in all the world's oceans. Only the blue whale, up to about 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and 150 tons, is larger.

Vogl said the nerves that supply the expandable tissues in the floor of the mouth can stretch to accommodate dramatic changes in oral cavity dimensions during "lunge feeding."

Rorqual whales possess grooved or pleated skin on the underside of their bodies, from the chin almost to the belly button, that balloons out as their mouths fill during lunge-feeding.

The research was published in the journal Current Biology.

The first of Inmarsat's high-capacity GlobalXpress satellites is being used in Nepal after the country was hit by an earthquake and ahead of a global launch for the technology set for later this year, the company said on Wednesday.

"We were able to rush terminals into Nepal, and the feedback from that has been great," Chief Executive Rupert Pearce said following release of the British satellite maker's first-quarter earnings.

The terminals provide voice and broadband data capability to help emergency relief workers communicate and media broadcast to send pictures.

It launched the second satellite for its new GlobalXpress high-capacity service in February which is not yet in service and a third is scheduled to go into orbit at the end of May or early June, Pearce said.

He said worldwide commercial service would start in August or September, slightly later than planned due to launch timings.

But he said he remained confident GlobalXpress would generate revenue of $500 million five years after it starts global commercial service.

Inmarsat on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue of $304.8 million, down from $344.7 million a year earlier as continued cuts in government defense budgets offset higher demand from shipping and aircraft.

"It was a very slightly soft start but it picked up well during the quarter," Pearce said. "We are going at a decent lick into the second."

Shares in the company, which had risen 28 percent since the start of the year to reach an all-time high of 1,022.6 pence on Friday, were down 3 percent to 957 pence by 0756 GMT on Wednesday.

It's a revolution in food technology that could deliver your food fantasy to your plate in less than a minute.

The Genie, similar in size and appearance to a coffee maker, can produce an unlimited variety of meals using pods, that contain natural dehydrated ingredients. So whether salty or sweet, an appetizer or a dessert, the device can create the food you crave in 30 seconds.

Developed by Israeli entrepreneurs Ayelet Carasso and Doron Marco from White Innovation company, the device uses a mobile app to operate.

"The dish can be anything, it can be a meal like chicken with rice, like couscous with vegetable or an amazing Ramen or even a chocolate soufflé or any other desert that you want," Carasso explains.

"We're using only natural ingredients, we're not using any preservatives or anything that people add to their meals," she added.

Meals are prepared in 140 gram portions in recyclable container.

At the push of a button on Genie's mobile application, the device begins mixing, shaking and adding any required liquids from tubes attached to the back of the compact machine which bakes or cooks the desired dish at the appropriate temperature.

The all-natural ingredients in the pods are freeze-dried and have a shelf-life of between one and two years.

Carasso and Marco conceived of the patent-registered device and pods, when they struggled to find restaurants that delivered to their office during a late night working session.

They describe the idea as a real life version of Star Trek's 'replicator', a device used to synthesize meals on demand, on board the mythical starship.

While the team don't expect the Genie to replace dining out, they say it will challenge chefs to produce a good meal in a pod, or small container.

Israeli chefs have already begun producing new recipes for Genie's pods and hope to develop product lines for well known culinary personalities as well as pods for specific dietary requirements, including sugar and gluten free.

The team say they are already working on expanding the capabilities of the mobile application and expect that in the future, Genie will cater to individual users.

"Eventually, Genie will know your microbiome and will prepare the pod for you, just for you and you will eat better, even tastier and healthier," said 47-year-old Marco.

White Innovation, a privately owned company, hopes to first move into convenience stores and cafes and later sell the appliance to individual consumers.

Marco said Genie is only the first step in the evolution of food technology and he believes the getting a meal in a pill will be available in the not too distant future.

While Genie's target population is primarily in western countries, Marco and Carasso say they designed the device with the hopes that it could day help those in countries that don't have enough food too. 

"In our world, we are getting fat and we are throwing away a lot of food, in their world, they don't have any food. So if you use Genie, you can distribute the food better, you can have the shelf life much longer without the preservatives, give the people better food for them," said Marco.

"We can even the food distribution in the world. That's a very, very important goal for us," he added.

Marco said they are also holding talks with the Israeli military where Genie's pods could produce fresh, nutritious meals on demand for ground forces or aboard ships at sea.

At a tasting at Louise cafe in Ramat Hashron, in central Israel, the kitchen staff were pleasantly surprised by Genie's chocolate soufflé.

"It's really nice, it's chocolatey, it's smooth, it's creamy, it's nice ... surprising actually coming from there," said Tal, Louise cafe's chef.

Yossi Orbach, co-owner of Louise cafe, who recently became Genie's sole distributor in Israel, said Genie can offer restaurant and cafe owners a way to increase the narrow profit  margins they make due to the fact that 30 percent of ingredients used in their kitchens go to waste. The meals can be prepared on demand and the size of the portions greatly limit waste.    

"In a way there is a full menu," Orbach said.  "It gives me an option to do, actually, whatever I want without any preparing," he added.

The Genie is expected to cost several hundred U.S. dollars.  The team say the pods will be priced so they are comparable to a meal, snack or dessert.

With a string of local distributors and sales underway in Europe, Greece and the United States, Marco and Carasso say mass production will begin sooner than they expected.

It appears that Star Trek's replicator may not have been such a far-fetched idea after all.

A self-cleaning paint that can withstand contact with substances such as oil, even after being scratched or scuffed with sandpaper, has been developed by British and Chinese researchers.

The coating was devised by University College London (UCL) researcher Yao Lu and his supervisor, Professor of Inorganic Chemistry Claire Carmalt, and can be applied to clothes, paper, glass and steel. When combined with adhesives, its self-cleaning properties remain, in spite of attempts to scratch or scuff it.

Self-cleaning surfaces work by being extremely repellent to water but are often rendered useless once damaged or exposed to strong substances like oil. Yet the self-cleaning properties of this new coating, made from titanium dioxide nanoparticles, work during and after immersion in problematic substances and following surface damage.

Yao developed an interest in developing the paint having become fascinated with the superhydrophobic - or water repelling - properties of plants, such as lotus and taro leaves. "I am quite interested in self-cleaning coatings in nature, such as plants," said Yao. "We put water on superhydrophobic plants, water wouldn't wet them. Instead the water will form drops and then roll off or just bounce away and leave the surface dry and clean."

The researchers say the new paint creates a resilient surface resistant to wear and tear, that could be used for real-world applications such as clothing and cars. They say that having completely water-resistant surfaces allows water to form marble-shaped droplets that roll over the surface, acting like miniature vacuum cleaners picking up dirt, viruses and bacteria.

According to Carmalt, "water is dropped onto the surface. It actually forms near spherical shaped balls which, as they roll across the surface, act like miniature vacuum cleaners picking up dirt and bacteria, and we can take that paint and we can adhere it onto hard surfaces like glass or metal, or soft surfaces like cotton and paper just using simple adhesives."

She added that the roughness of the surface is created by having two different sizes of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, with the waxy texture formed by adding fluorosilane.

The experiments were filmed to show the behavior of the treated surfaces. One video shows treated paper remaining dry and clean after being exposed to dirt and water.

Carmalt says the biggest challenge for the widespread application of self-cleaning surfaces is finding a way to make them tough enough to withstand everyday damage. She said the UCL team's coating is superior to other superhydrophobic substances available. "I think the improvement is the fact that we get this very resistant coating, so generally these superhydrophobic coatings are very mechanically weak, so can be easily rubbed off over time, whereas by applying this spray adhesive we've managed to get very resistant coatings that are resistant to, as I say, rubbing or scratching and with sandpaper and so on," she said.

Carmalt says the process could easily be scaled-up for industrial applications, such as car spray paint. It could also be used in antimicrobial coatings to combat hospital acquired infections.

The study, which also involved researchers from Imperial College London and Dalian University of Technology (China), was published recently in Science.

Music streaming service Spotify is laying plans to enter the Web video business and has been in discussions with several digital media players about potential partnerships, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company has been reaching out to companies that specialize in making content for Google Inc's YouTube to discuss both acquiring their material and co-creating original video series, the Journal said.

Spotify could announce its video plans as early as this month, the report said.

Spotify declined to comment.

The company is nearing a deal to raise $400 million, valuing it at $8.4 billion, the Wall Street Journal had reported last month.

Spotify, which competes with Pandora Media Inc and Apple Inc's Beats, said in January it had 15 million subscribers and 60 million active users at the end of 2014.

AT&T Inc will take "a couple of years" to shape up its new business in Mexico, where it competes with billionaire Carlos Slim's dominant carrier America Movil, AT&T Mexico Chief Executive Thaddeus Arroyo said in an interview on Thursday.

AT&T, which bought Mexico's No.3 and No.4 wireless carriers in the last few months, faces the task of integrating the two companies' networks to face off against Slim's telecoms group, which controls 70 percent of the mobile market.

The purchases gave AT&T, which was looking for growth outside the saturated U.S. wireless market, a cheap foothold in Latin America, but analysts don't see the Mexico unit having a major impact for some time.

"What we really want to do over the long term is deploy advanced fourth generation services to over 100 million Mexicans ... That will take a number of years," Arroyo said on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum summit on Latin America in the Riviera Maya.

AT&T is in the vanguard of companies seeking to benefit from sweeping telecoms sector overhaul finalized last year. The reform is forcing Slim to open up infrastructure and let rivals interconnect to his network for free.

"It actually will take us a couple of years to ultimately begin to enhance and begin to deploy the experiences that we're looking for," said Arroyo.

AT&T has said that Iusacell, whose previous owners never broke down numbers in detail, made a $27 million first quarter operating loss. AT&T also lowered Iusacell's number of subscribers to 5.97 million from the 9.2 million it said when the deal closed in January.

Arroyo highlighted Mexico's growing middle class and a relatively young population, and emphasized that companies are better positioned than government to enhance wireless services "because networks are living organisms to a degree."

He said that for the company to reach its goal of becoming market leader within a decade, it needs to be successful in both prepaid and postpaid mobile contracts.

Asked if the company is considering the acquisition of any America Movil assets, Arroyo demurred.

"We'll always continue to look at other alternatives in the market, but right now we really have our hands full," he said.

AT&T's purchase of DirecTV, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, would make it and Spanish-language television content Grupo Televisa co-investors in Mexico's biggest pay TV provider Sky.

European Union antitrust regulators are not investigating U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm on its patent licensing deals, an EU source said on Thursday, refuting media reports saying the issue was on the European Commission's radar.

"The Commission is currently not investigating a possible abuse by Qualcomm with regard to the licensing of standard essential patents," said the source, declining to be named because the person is not authorized to speak to the media.

The EU antitrust authority however is looking into Qualcomm's sale and manufacturing of its chipsets, including rebates and other incentives offered by the company, to see if these are anti-competitive.

A U.S. spying program that systematically collects millions of Americans' phone records is illegal, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday, putting pressure on Congress to quickly decide whether to replace or end a controversial program aimed at fighting terrorism.

Ruling on a program revealed in 2013 by former government security contractor Edward Snowden, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the Patriot Act did not authorize the National Security Agency to collect Americans' calling records in bulk.

Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote for a three-judge panel that Section 215, which addresses the FBI's ability to gather business records, could not be interpreted to have permitted the NSA to collect a "staggering" amount of phone records, contrary to claims by the Bush and Obama administrations.

"Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans," Lynch wrote in a 97-page decision. "We would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language. There is no evidence of such a debate."

The appeals court did not resolve the question of whether the surveillance was unconstitutional.

It also declined to halt the program, noting that parts of the Patriot Act including Section 215 expire on June 1.

Lynch said it was "prudent" to give Congress a chance to decide what surveillance is permissible, given the national security interests at stake.

Enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the Patriot Act gives the government a wide variety of tools to investigate terrorism.

Thursday's decision voided a December 2013 ruling in which U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan found the NSA program lawful. The appeals court sent the case back to him for further review.

NEXT STEP IN CONGRESS

Snowden, a former NSA contractor who lives as a fugitive in Russia, in June 2013 gave several media outlets classified information. Snowden exposed the agency's collection of "bulk telephony metadata." The data includes the existence and duration of calls made, but not the content of conversations.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a Senate budget hearing on Thursday that NSA data collection was a "vital tool in our national security arsenal," and that she was unaware of privacy violations under its existing program.

The 2nd Circuit is the first federal appeals court to rule on the NSA program's legality. Federal appeals courts in Washington, D.C. and California are also considering the matter.

While the government could appeal Thursday's decision, it may wait for Congress. If Congress changes Section 215, then courts may need to review what it does. But if it reauthorizes Section 215, the issue could end up before the Supreme Court.

Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said President Barack Obama wants to end the NSA program, and is encouraged by the "good progress" Congress is making to find an alternative that preserves its "essential capabilities."

Last week, the House Judiciary Committee voted 25-2 in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which would end the bulk collection of telephone data, and the bill is expected to pass the full House.

A similar bill has been proposed in the Senate, but passage remains uncertain.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have introduced legislation to extend Section 215 and other parts of the Patriot Act through 2020.

The existing NSA program has repeatedly been approved in secret by a national security court established under a 1978 law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

"FISA has been critically important in keeping us safe in America," McConnell said on Thursday.

COUNTER-PUNCH

Other senators welcomed Thursday's decision.

Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and presidential candidate, tweeted that "phone records of law abiding citizens are none of the NSA's business! Pleased with the ruling this morning."

Another presidential candidate, Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, tweeted that "the NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner."

In upholding the NSA program in 2013, Pauley had called it a government "counter-punch" to terrorism at home and abroad.

Pauley ruled 11 days after U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C. said the "almost Orwellian" program might violate the Fourth Amendment. Leon issued an injunction to block the program but put it on hold pending appeal.

Thursday's decision did not resolve the ACLU's claim that the NSA program violated the bar against warrantless searches under the Fourth Amendment.

Lynch, though, did note the "seriousness" of the constitutional concerns over "the extent to which modern technology alters our traditional expectations of privacy."

ACLU lawyer Alex Abdo welcomed the decision.

"Mass surveillance does not make us any safer, and it is fundamentally incompatible with the privacy necessary in a free society," he said.

The case is American Civil Liberties Union et al v. Clapper et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-42.

China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] is undeterred by the merger of telecoms equipment rivals Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent and will keep growing in Europe, its rotating Chief Executive Guo Ping told Reuters on Thursday.

The merged European entity will become the global No.2 in wireless behind Sweden's Ericsson. It will also have a more complete product line encompassing both mobile and fixed-line operations, putting it in a stronger position to compete with Huawei, the leading telecoms equipment maker.

Finland's Nokia announced its acquisition of France's Alcatel-Lucent last month as it seeks to strengthen its position in telecoms equipment.

However, Huawei's Guo welcomed the deal, saying it would spur investment and competition, and expressed optimism about his company's ability to expand its own network gear business.

"The merged company will be much more competitive and for the industry as a whole this is a positive thing," he said.

"This is combining one company that is very strong in the wireless business with another company (that is) very strong in fixed networks."

Huawei expects lucrative opportunities for its network gear business as more people use smartphones, everyday objects are connected to the web and machines are linked to each other via the Internet, Guo added. He said there could be 100 billion new connections in the next ten years.

He also dismissed the effects of Huawei's exclusion from the United States over cybersecurity concerns, saying its global growth would not be stymied as a result.

"Without the U.S. market Huawei will still be able to develop well," he said.

Huawei on Thursday announced plans for a new research institute in Brussels, signaling its intent to take part in Europe's race to be at the forefront of the next generation of mobile broadband technology.

Its sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 20 percent last year to 101 billion yuan ($16.27 billion), far higher than all other regions apart from China, where sales grew 31 percent, the privately held company's published results said.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday posted a 45 percent rise in quarterly revenue, and shares of the Chinese e-commerce company jumped nearly 7 percent as investors cheered a smoother-than-expected transition to mobile transactions, which surpassed those from personal computers for the first time.

The company said Chief Operating Officer Daniel Zhang would become chief executive on May 10, replacing Jonathan Lu. Lu was CEO for two years, a low-key leader who was frequently eclipsed by outspoken founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma. Lu will remain on the board as vice chairman.

Alibaba's quarterly revenue jumped 45 percent to $2.81 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.77 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares jumped 6.9 percent to $85.54 at midday in the U.S. trading session.

"It was a very good quarter which is especially important considering there were a lot of expectations that the results would not come in strong," said Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities. "Sentiment is going to swing back to the favorable side."

Zhang takes the helm as the sprawling e-commerce company puts greater emphasis on reaching customers via mobile devices in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.

The company did not explain the reason for the change but Executive Chairman Ma said in a letter to staff he was pleased to see the reins going to a leader born in the 1970s. Zhang was born in 1972 while his predecessor was born in 1969.

Despite the change, Ma is seen as the driving force and the public face of the company. Analyst Tian Hou at Capital Research in Beijing said Zhang would be a thorough executive who executes well and believes in consensus. “He quietly gets things done,” she said.

Despite the strong fourth quarter, the incoming CEO could face slowing growth as saturation among online shoppers threatens to hobble expansion, along with stiff competition from domestic rivals Tencent Holding Ltd (0700.HK), Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) on mobile.

The total value of transactions made on Alibaba's platforms, known as gross merchandise volume (GMV), grew 40 percent to $97 billion in the quarter ended March 31. This was the lowest rate of growth in at least 11 quarters, despite sales on mobile devices growing 257 percent year-on-year to account for 51 percent of overall GMV.

Alibaba may also be facing e-commerce user saturation. The increase of annual active buyers, or customers who buy at least one product a year via Alibaba, was the smallest in 3-1/2 years, up 5 percent from the previous quarter to 350 million.

The group will continue investing in areas such as digital entertainment, cloud computing and mobile Internet, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told a conference call.

Zhang will also take on decelerating profit growth.

Alibaba's net income excluding extraordinary and one-off items grew 16 percent year-on-year, a far cry from 48 percent growth the previous year and triple-digit gains in the 12 months before that.

ItBit Trust Company, LLC, a bitcoin exchange, has been granted a charter under New York State’s banking law, becoming the first virtual currency company to receive a charter in the state, according to New York’s Department of Financial Services.

The exchange can begin operating immediately, but will be required to meet the obligations for both a trust company under New York law and upcoming “BitLicense” regulations, the state agency said.

New York's Department of Financial Services is expected to issue final regulations to license bitcoin and other virtual currencies later this month.

German industrial group Siemens will cut a further 4,500 jobs as it battles to cope with subdued economic growth and weak demand from energy customers.

The cuts come on top of 7,400 job losses already announced and were unveiled on Thursday alongside a 5 percent drop in first-quarter profit at its industrial businesses.

The trains-to-turbines group currently employs around 340,000 people worldwide, including about 115,000 in Germany where it is one of the country's biggest employers.

Chief Executive Joe Kaeser did not say where the new cuts would be geographically. Siemens has to tread carefully cutting jobs in Germany, where trade unions are strong, and it has reduced previously announced job losses by a few hundred.

However Kaeser, who is trying to trim the company to help it close a profitability gap with rivals General Electric and ABB, said he would keep underperforming businesses that account for 15 billion euros ($16.9 billion) in sales and zero profit, confirming a Reuters story.

This, combined with the lacklustre quarterly results that made Siemens' full-year targets look ambitious, pushed its shares down more than 2 percent, close to the bottom of the blue-chip DAX index.

"It might seem slow to you but I know of no other company that has effected such a fundamental change in such a small space of time," said Kaeser, who took over in 2013 after a messy boardroom coup, on a call with journalists.

Kaeser has already agreed the most expensive acquisition in Siemens' history -- that of U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand for $7.6 billion -- as well as beginning to hive off healthcare and firing a host of senior managers.

But he is fighting on many fronts as sluggish economic growth in major markets dampens infrastructure spending, while weak demand and a drive for more renewable power hurt the energy businesses that account for about 40 percent of Siemens' sales.

"The Power and Gas Division is having to cope, among other things, with regulatory changes, massive price erosion, aggressive competitors and regional overcapacities," Siemens said.

Siemens' key industrial profit margin, where it is targeting 10-11 percent of sales this fiscal year, fell to 9.0 percent in the quarter from 10.3 percent a year earlier.

The target is far below General Electric's 14.6 percent industrial margin in the first quarter or Swiss engineer ABB's 13.5 percent operating margin.

"What Siemens presented today is anything but inspiring numbers," said fund manager Christoph Niesel of Union Investment, a top 10 Siemens shareholder.

"The numbers ... confirm a continuing difficult business environment for capital-goods companies."

AMBITIOUS MARGIN TARGET

Siemens said it anticipated some potential market softness in China and the United States in the second half.

It said it would still reach the lower end of its 10-11 percent industrial profit margin target for the full year, helped by the new cuts.

But Barclays analysts, who rate the stock "underweight", were not convinced. "We struggle to see how the company will reach a 10-11 percent industrial margin," they wrote.

About two-thirds of the new job cuts will be in the underperforming businesses, which Siemens said employed 43-44,000 people worldwide, with most of the rest in power and gas.

Siemens declined to detail what all the underperforming businesses were, saying it preferred to deal with its problems in private and then announce the results, but said they included mechanical drives, compressors and transformers.

The drop in Siemens' quarterly industrial profit to 1.7 billion euros, including 98 million in restructuring costs, was slightly steeper than expected, according to a Reuters poll of analysts whose forecasts averaged 1.78 billion.

Power and Gas performed better than expected with a profit drop of 34 percent, as did Healthcare with a 2 percent slide.

But profits at the Digital Factory unit where Siemens hopes to gain an edge by combining its expertise in industrial software and plant automation unexpectedly fell 13 percent.

Group orders rose 7 percent on a comparable basis to a better-than-expected 20.8 billion euros, helped by large rail orders, while sales were flat at 18 billion. Both top-line results were flattered by the weak euro.

Japanese videogame maker Nintendo Co Ltd forecast its long-awaited entry into smartphone games would help it double annual operating profit in the year through March, offsetting weak sales growth in its traditional consoles.

Nintendo repeatedly resisted investor calls to shift focus to smartphone games to boost profitability, until it unveiled a gaming app partnership in March with DeNA Co Ltd. On Thursday, it said would also branch out to theme parks through a tie-up with Universal Parks & Resorts.

The newly venturesome approach comes as Nintendo's Wii U console lags behind Sony Corp's PlayStation and Microsoft Corp's XBox, while the rise of smartphone games has also led to a decline in customers.

Though console sales are slowing, Nintendo forecast operating profit would roughly double to 50 billion yen ($419.71 million) in the year through next March, ahead of the 39 billion yen average forecast of 20 analysts to Thomson Reuters data.

Nintendo Chief Executive Satoru Iwata said that outlook assumed a "certain level of profit" from the DeNA partnership.

"We definitely want one game this year. And after that we want to come out with new applications, and make sure each one is a hit," he told reporters at an earnings briefing in Osaka.

DeNA Chief Executive Isao Moriyasu said in April that he hopes the pair can come up with titles that bring in over 3 billion yen a month.

In a sign of further diversification, Nintendo also said on Thursday that it would allow Universal Parks & Resorts, a subsidiary of Comcast NBCUniversal, to use its characters for new theme park attractions.

The two companies did not provide details on the timing or scale of the partnership. Iwata said they could collaborate at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka or other Universal theme parks.

Earlier on Thursday, Nintendo said it booked operating profit of 24.8 billion yen for the year ended March 31, turning into the black for the first time in four years due to the lower cost of sales.

For the year ahead, the company forecast Wii U sales to be roughly flat at around 3.4 million consoles, with those of its 3DS portable console likely to fall to 7.6 million from 8.7 million a year earlier.

Shares of Nintendo closed 2.5 percent lower ahead of the earnings release, versus a 1.2 percent fall in the broader market.

Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] said Thursday it will open a new research institute in Brussels as it expands its footprint in Europe, an increasingly important market for the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.

The new European Research Institute will serve as a hub overseeing the company's 18 European research and development sites as well as carry out research in 5G telecom technology with European partners, it said.

In recent years Huawei executives, including founder Ren Zhengfei, have detailed a strategy shift away from the United States - where political sensitivities over cybersecurity have hampered the Chinese firm - and towards Europe, a growth market where customers such as Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Vodafone are expected to spend heavily.

Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 20 percent in 2014 to 101 billion yuan ($16.27 billion), far higher than any region except China, where sales grew 31 percent, according to the privately-held company's published results.

European governments have proved more friendly to Shenzhen-based Huawei, which pledged last year to double its number of research and development employees in the continent to 1,700. The company currently runs 5G research divisions in Surrey, England and Munich, Germany, among other locations.

Huawei declined to disclose the amount invested in the new institute, but rotating chief executive Guo Ping said in a statement the company viewed Europe as a "favorable industrial environment" and would strengthen its cooperation with European industry and academia.

Telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA), which is set to be bought by larger rival Nokia (NOK1V.HE), improved profit margins in the first quarter despite a marked sales slowdown in its biggest market, the United States.

Although it reported a net loss, higher software sales, a weak euro, and strong demand for its Internet routing products - which help telecom operators handle heavy broadband traffic from online video - helped the French firm post a better quarter than Nokia and mobile market leader Ericsson (ERICb.ST).

Both those competitors saw steep drops in their shares after missing profit targets, and Nokia's misstep prompted some Alcatel shareholders to say the takeover deal terms should be renegotiated.

Alcatel-Lucent Chief Executive Michel Combes dismissed the idea on Thursday, saying there was no need to change the deal since both companies were sticking to their annual targets.

"The strategic rationale of the deal does not depend on the performance of an isolated quarter," he said.

"There is no reason for any change."

Alexander Peterc, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the results showed a "significant divergence versus weak peers Nokia and Ericsson".

Alcatel shares were up 2.8 percent at 3.30 euro at 07:41 GMT, the biggest gainers on the on the French blue-chip CAC 40 index .FCHI. They had previously fallen nearly 30 percent since the acquisition by Nokia was announced in mid-April, hit by investor scepticism about the merits of the deal.

Nokia's acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent aims to position the company to better compete with Sweden's Ericsson as well as low-cost Chinese powerhouse Huawei [HWT.UL] by forging a strong number two in mobile with a more complete product line.

Alcatel-Lucent shareholders will get 0.55 shares in Nokia for every Alcatel-Lucent share, ending up with 33.5 percent of the enlarged group once the deal closes in mid-2016.

OUTPERFORMANCE

Alcatel-Lucent's first-quarter revenue rose 9 percent on a comparable basis to 3.24 billion euros ($3.68 billion), ahead of a company-provided consensus of 3.02 billion, while adjusted operating profit nearly doubled to 82 million euros compared with a consensus of 79 million.

The company posted a net loss of 72 million euros - almost flat to the 73 million loss a year before - but some measures of profitability improved because of cost cuts as well as the sale more higher margin products and software.

The gross margin improved to 34.6 percent in the quarter from 32.3 percent a year ago, and the operating margin was 2.5 percent versus 1.1 percent.

"The topline and gross margin beat are impressive, especially in the context of weak North America spending and after the very disappointing results of Nokia and Ericsson on that front," said Bernstein Research analyst Pierre Ferragu.

Alcatel-Lucent earns almost half its revenue in North America where it supplies mobile and broadband gear to Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N).

The group confirmed its aim to generate positive free cash flow by the end of the year, the central aim of Combes' turnaround. But it consumed 332 million euro more cash than it generated in the quarter, an improvement of 66 million.

Authorities in China's southwestern city of Chengdu visited the offices of Uber on Wednesday as part of a new investigation into the online taxi-hailing service, a spokeswoman for Chengdu's transportation commission said.

The visit is the second made by authorities to Uber's China offices in the last week. The official Xinhua news agency said on Friday Guangzhou authorities raided Uber's office there on suspicion of an "unlicensed operation".

"A few of our departments visited Uber's offices to conduct interviews or an investigation," the spokeswoman, who gave only her surname, said on Thursday.

Ren said she did not know the details of the investigation.

A spokeswoman for Uber in China said the visit was routine, citing a statement from the Transport Committee of Chengdu quoted by Chinese media. She did not provide more details.

"There are no disruptions to the Uber platform and it's business as usual," she said in a statement.

Uber, which has been valued at an estimated $40 billion, is a comparative latecomer in China, where the number of mobile taxi-hailing app users is forecast to triple to 45 million by 2015 from 2013, according to Chinese research firm iResearch.

Domestic firms Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache, backed by tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd respectively, have 90 percent of the market sewn up. The two said in February they would merge.

Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday its new $14 billion South Korean chip plant, which is expected to help drive growth as smartphone earnings slow, will start production sometime in the first half of 2017.

The world's No.2 chip maker by revenue did not specify what products will be made at the new production line, which will be built in the city of Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul.

Samsung has said it will invest 15.6 trillion won ($14.4 billion) in the facility, the biggest amount it has ever committed to a single plant.

Domestic online news service MoneyToday has also reported that Samsung is set to spend at least another 10 trillion won on the factory to boost capacity although it did not say when the additional investment would take place.

"The Pyeongtaek semiconductor plant will play a central role in solidifying leadership in the mobile and server markets, which have shown rapid growth in demand recently, and securing share in the next-generation internet of things market," Samsung said in a statement.

Local media have reported that Samsung plans to produce DRAM memory chips at the new plant, but have also said some capacity could be allocated to mobile processors depending on market demand.

The leader of Facebook Inc's fast-growing Seattle office left the company last month, a spokeswoman for the online social network told Reuters on Wednesday, a crucial personnel change at Facebook's largest engineering office outside of its Silicon Valley headquarters.

Engineering manager Paul Carduner, who took over leadership of the Seattle office about six months ago, was in charge of more than 600 people.

In February he announced a lease on space in a new building in Seattle with room for more than 2,000 Facebook employees. The office is expecting to move there in January 2016.

Facebook did not publicize his departure and it has not been reported previously. No replacement has been named, a source at the company told Reuters, and senior staff in Seattle are sharing Carduner's duties.

Carduner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His Facebook page shows a post saying he left Facebook April 17 and started working from home as a "house husband" on April 18. He does not give any indication of why he left Facebook.

The social network's fast-growing Seattle office is the biggest in terms of engineering staff after its Menlo Park, California, headquarters. Facebook is hiring quickly across the board, not just in Seattle. Last quarter it passed 10,000 employees worldwide for the first time.

The Seattle office has played a critical role in developing many of the features in Facebook's mobile and messaging apps, and has recruited heavily from local tech companies, especially Microsoft Corp.

Videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts and reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by growth in its high-margin digital business.

Videogame publishers are shifting to the lucrative digital business from physical sales of games as consumers shift from consoles to playing on smartphones and tablets.

Revenue from Activision Blizzard's digital business rose 53.3 percent in the first quarter ended March 31 from a year earlier, helped by robust online sales of "Destiny" and its "Call of Duty" franchise.

Last month, the company launched "Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft" on iOS and Android mobile phones.

Rival Electronic Arts Inc has already made smartphone versions of its top-selling games "Madden NFL" and "FIFA". EA reported better-than-expected results on Tuesday, helped by strong digital sales and the release of "Battlefield Hardline".

In May 2006, Activision Blizzard bought RedOctane Inc, the videogame publisher behind the popular Guitar Hero franchise, which has been played by more than 40 million gamers.

Activision Blizzard had said earlier that it planned to launch the next generation of Guitar Hero this fall and that the game would be available across consoles, smartphones and tablet devices.

"It's a good story," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said, adding that Guitar Hero would "add a lot" to the company's slate.

Activision Blizzard, also known for its "World of Warcraft", "Skylanders" and "Diablo" franchises, raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $1.20 per share from $1.15 earlier.

Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.18 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also raised its full-year adjusted revenue forecast to $4.43 billion from $4.40 billion earlier.

Activision Blizzard reported adjusted revenue of $703 million in the first quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $655.4 million.

The company's net income rose to $394 million, or 53 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $293 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, it earned 16 cents per share, well above the average estimate of 7 cents.

Up to Wednesday's close, Activision Blizzard's shares had risen about 15 percent this year. The stock was little changed in after-market trading.

Fourteen U.S. and Canadian cancer institutes will use International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N) Watson computer system to choose therapies based on a tumor's genetic fingerprints, the company said on Tuesday, the latest step toward bringing personalized cancer treatments to more patients.

Oncology is the first specialty where matching therapy to DNA has improved outcomes for some patients, inspiring the "precision medicine initiative" President Barack Obama announced in January.

But it can take weeks to identify drugs targeting cancer-causing mutations. Watson can do it in minutes and has in its database the findings of scientific papers and clinical trials on particular cancers and potential therapies.

Faced with such a data deluge, "the solution is going to be Watson or something like it," said oncologist Norman Sharpless of the University of North Carolina Lineberger Cancer Center. "Humans alone can't do it."

It is unclear how many patients will be helped by such a "big data" approach, however. For one thing, in many common cancers old-line chemotherapy and radiation will remain the standard of care and genomic analysis may not make a difference.

Cloud-based Watson will be used at the centers – including Cleveland Clinic, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center in Omaha and Yale Cancer Center – by late 2015, said Steve Harvey, vice president of IBM Watson Health. The centers pay a subscription fee, which IBM did not disclose.

Oncologists will upload the DNA fingerprint of a patient's tumor, which indicates which genes are mutated and possibly driving the malignancy. Watson, recognized broadly for beating two champions of the game show Jeopardy! in 2011, will sift through thousands of mutations and try to identify which is driving the tumor, and therefore what a drug must target.

Distinguishing driver mutations from others is a huge challenge. IBM spent more than a year developing a scoring system so Watson can do that, since targeting non-driver mutations would not help.

"Watson will look for actionable targets," Harvey said, matching them to approved and experimental cancer drugs and even non-cancer drugs (if Watson decides the latter interfere with a biological pathway driving a malignancy).

But Watson has trouble identifying actionable targets in cancers with many mutations. Although genetic profiling is standard in melanoma and some lung cancers, where drugs such as Zelboraf from the Genentech unit of Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) target the driver mutation, in most common tumors traditional chemotherapy and radiation remain the standard of care.

"When institutions do genetic sequencing, only about half the cases come back with something actionable," Harvey said, often because it is impossible to identify the driver mutation or no targeted therapy exists.

The other collaborating centers are Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago; BC Cancer Agency in British Columbia; City of Hope, in Duarte, California; Duke Cancer Institute in North Carolina; McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis; New York Genome Center, Sanford Health in South Dakota; University of Kansas Cancer Center; University of Southern California Center for Applied Molecular Medicine, and University of Washington Medical Center.

The EU unveiled plans to shake up rules for online services in the hope that breaking down borders can revive the bloc's economy, but risks accusations of trying to throw up new barriers to the U.S. firms that dominate its market.

With some fanfare, the European Commission presented a range of broad policy proposals on Wednesday. They range from possible new regulation for Web platforms like Google and Facebook to popular plans for cutting delivery costs on online shopping over EU borders and ending blocks on watching online videos abroad.

The Digital Single Market Strategy is central to Jean-Claude Juncker's strategy to create jobs across the 28-nation bloc and the Commission president, in office since November, won cautious plaudits from across EU politics for what remain general ideas.

"Today, we lay the groundwork for Europe’s digital future," said Juncker, who posted a jokey online video for the occasion, seeking to burnish the EU's threadbare populist credentials.

"I want to see pan-continental telecoms networks, digital services that cross borders and a wave of innovative European start-ups. I want to see every consumer getting the best deals and every business accessing the widest market," he said.

Representatives of big U.S. tech companies, however, already smarting from last month's move by the new Commission to pursue Google on antitrust charges, warned against snaring fast-moving industries in ways that would hurt a Europe that U.S. President Barack Obama recently accused of taking a protectionist turn.

"The idea of regulating platforms is ill-conceived," the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said in a statement after confirmation of the EU plan to complete a major review of the platform business by the end of the year to assess the value of calls for them to be more tightly overseen.

Such rules could hurt the small European start-ups more than incumbent global giants with big legal teams, the CCIA argued.

E-COMMERCE INQUIRY

As well as the inquiry into online platforms, the EU's competition commissioner confirmed she would investigate the e-commerce sector for possible breaches of antitrust law, especially in relation to postal charges.

European Union leaders reject charges of anti-Americanism in their efforts to reshape online markets at home. But there is no lack of suspicion among European voters and politicians at the power of U.S. tech companies, not least following revelations in recent years that Washington has been spying on its allies.

"Europeanization of digital policy is absolutely the way to go," said Guenther Oettinger, the commissioner for the digital economy. "(It) will give us digital sovereignty which we don't always have."

A German conservative, Oettinger is a vocal critic of U.S. might in a sector where German media companies have, for example, been lobbying to protect content from online giants.

The review of platforms, which had been expected, will focus on the transparency of search results and pricing policies, how platforms use data they acquire, their relationships with other businesses and how fairly they promote their own services.

The overall strategy, laid out by Juncker's vice-president for digital Andrus Ansip, includes a set of initiatives focusing on reforming copyright and national telecoms rules, knocking down barriers to cross-border parcel deliveries and helping start-ups to sell online by simplifying sales tax across the EU.

He aims to deliver on his promises by the end of next year, setting up battles with a variety of industrial interests.

EU telecoms regulations will also be overhauled next year.

Telecom operators welcomed the announcement, saying that reforming the rules would lead to greater investment in Europe's ageing copper networks. But alternative operators warned against tolerating monopoly power to subsidize spending.

From ways to eavesdrop on brains and learn what advertisements excite consumers, to devices that alleviate depression, the number of U.S. patents awarded for "neurotechnology" has soared since 2010, according to an analysis released on Wednesday.

Most surprising, concluded market-research firm SharpBrains, is that patents have been awarded to inventors well beyond those at medical companies. The leader in neurotechnology patents, according to the report, is consumer-research behemoth Nielsen.

That expansion into non-medical uses, said SharpBrains Chief Executive Alvaro Fernandez, who presented the results at the NeuroGaming conference in San Francisco, shows we are at the dawn of "the pervasive neurotechnology age," in which everyday technologies will be connected to brains.

"Neurotech has gone well beyond medicine, with non-medical corporations, often under the radar, developing neurotechnologies to enhance work and life," he said.

Patents for neurotechnology bumped along at 300 to 400 a year in the 2000s, then soared to 800 in 2010 and 1,600 last year, SharpBrains reported.

Those awarded to medical device company Medtronic PLC, for instance, include ways to use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the severity of a brain lesion. Several held by medical technology company St. Jude Medical Inc. describe ways to change brain activity to, say, improve vision.

But it is the explosion in non-medical uses, such as controlling video games with brain waves, that is driving neurotechnology.

SharpBrains measured "intellectual property (IP) strength" by number of neurotechnology patents as well as patent quality, reflected in how many other patents reference them, for instance.

By that measure, Nielsen leads the pack, with patents describing ways to detect brain activity with EEG and translate it into what someone truly thinks about, say, a new product, advertising, or packaging.

Microsoft Corp. holds patents that assess mental states, with the goal of determining the most effective way to present information. If software knows a user's attention is wandering, it could hold back complicated material.

Another Microsoft patent describes a neuro-system that claims to discern whether a computer user is amenable to receiving advertisements.

Such patents reflect the enthusiasm for neuro-monitoring, something many scientists say has not been shown to be more effective than, say, asking people what they think about a product.

On a lighter note, an EEG patent awarded to San Jose-based biosensors company NeuroSky describes a design for a headset that could deliver music based on a user's brainwaves, perhaps a ballad when the listener is feeling contemplative.

New York City programmer Bana Malik was passionate about computers and mathematics from an early age, a video games enthusiast and email user way before many of her male friends.

But early in her studies at New York's Columbia University, Malik took a computer science class and felt out of place in such a male-dominated environment - a common experience for women and minorities seeking work in an industry dominated by white men.

"I didn't see many of the women around me get into this (field), so I felt like I didn't really need this," Malik, 31, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The technology industry is plagued not only by a gender gap but also by a broad lack of inclusiveness that affects minorities too, experts say.

"If you don't have a diverse group (of workers), how are you going to address the needs of a diverse group of people?" Robin Hauser Reynolds, the San Francisco-based director of a documentary on the topic, said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

It wasn't always this way.

Reynolds' documentary film "Code: Debugging the Gender Gap," shows that women played a key role in the early days of computer science and technology.

Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and Lord Byron's daughter who lived in the 19th century, was one of the first women pioneers in the field.

Computer scientist and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper is widely credited with creating a groundbreaking programming language in the 1950s.

In the mid-1980s, women accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of computer science students in the United States. Today that has dropped to about 16 percent, according to data cited by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Tech giant Google reported that 30 percent of its global workforce were women as of January 2014, while Twitter had a 30 percent global female workforce, and Yahoo 37 percent, according to data from the companies.

WHY SO FEW WOMEN?

Reynolds' documentary, screened at this year's Tribeca Film Festival, delves into the question of why the tech industry has become a "boys' club".

"It's a deeply cultural problem, it's a stereotype problem" that begins early on in the classroom, Reynolds said.

Until the age of about 13 in middle school, girls fare just as well as boys in math and science, but then they stop raising their hand with the right answer, she said.

"Suddenly, they're conscious of their image, they don't want to be the nerdy girls, the smart girls. They want to be the cool and popular girls."

Many young women who enroll in computer science in college feel isolated and out of place and, like Reynolds' daughter, drop out of the course, discouraged by the predominance of the "nerd" or "geek", the young man who spends day and night looking at numbers and code on a computer screen.

"The way the classes are being taught, the make-up of the classes in college, that's part of the pipeline issue," said Reynolds.

Joanne Cohoon, an associate professor of science, technology and society at the University of Virginia, has said that girls are often expected to have interests that are fundamentally different from those of boys, and that this can create a gender imbalance in work like computer science.

If computer science was mandatory in schools in the United States - as it is, for example, in Britain - girls would be more comfortable with the subject from an early age, Reynolds said.

"We should be teaching (girls) that actually you can get into fashion, into film, all sorts of really cool things (with code)."

FILLING THE GAP

The dearth of women and minorities in the tech world also creates an economic problem, she said.

A study cited by the White House said 1.4 million computer science jobs would be available by 2020, but only 400,000 graduates would be there to fill the openings.

"The need (for women) is drastic," said Cohoon, who runs workshops with her husband to help teachers increase the number of girls and minorities taking computer science classes.

Despite the initial hurdles, Malik did pursue a career in computer science and now works at Codecademy, a website that teaches people how to code and to build websites, among other things - and says that half its users are women.

Bonnie Eisenman, a software engineer at Codecademy, said Reynolds' film exposed many of the tech industry's problems.

"If (I) show up to a tech meeting, I am usually asked where my boyfriend is," she said. "It's an environment where people just don't expect you to be there."

American Nobel laureate Irwin Rose, a biochemist whose groundbreaking work helped in the development of treatments for cervical cancer and cystic fibrosis, died on Tuesday, the University of California, Irvine said. He was 88.

Rose won the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry, along with Israel Institute of Technology researchers Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko, for research into how cells break down and dispose of old and damaged proteins in plants and animals.

"These findings of the 'kiss-of-death' mechanisms inside cells proved revolutionary, transforming the field of cell biology and ultimately fostering a new understanding of the molecular activity present in cancer and other diseases," the university said.

Errors in the degradation process can lead to diseases such as cervical cancer and cystic fibrosis, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the time it made the Nobel award.

Rose died in his sleep in Deerfield, Massachusetts, his family told the university, where he worked during the latter part of his career.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1926, Rose earned a doctoral degree at the University of Chicago in 1952. He spent most of his career at the Fox Chase Center in Philadelphia.

In 1997, Rose took up a special research position with the department of physiology and biophysics at the University of California, Irvine.

A new study to determine the age of iconic old-growth redwoods in California's Muir Woods has revealed that one of the tallest and most famous trees in the forest is much younger than many assumed given its massive size, scientists said on Tuesday.

Tree 76, so named because it towers 76 meters or 249 feet above the forest floor, is 777 years old, much younger than the oldest known redwood, according to a study by Humboldt State University, which has long been working with conservation group Save the Redwoods League on the impact of climate change on the trees.

"Tree 76 is one of the larger trees that you can walk near so I think people have been guessing about its age for a long time," Save the Redwoods League Science Director Emily Burns said. "We know Redwoods can live quite a long time. The oldest one that we know of is 2,500 years old."

Redwoods include the tallest living trees on Earth.

Though visitors often ask the age of the tree in Muir Woods, located in the same area that famously played host to a 1945 United Nations meeting, this is the first time scientists can give an accurate answer, Burns said.

Researchers from Humboldt were able to climb the massive trees last year to take various pencil thin core samples that they can use to compare and determine not only the age of the tree but the structure and biodiversity as well.

The research is aimed at better understanding how climate change and major weather events such as drought impacted the redwoods in the past and how they might be affected in the future.

Burns said that large trees are often thought of as being at least 1,500 years old, but that smaller trees can be much older than the giant redwoods, named for the reddish color of their bark.

"Age and size don't correlate well," Burns said, adding that this is the first time the age of 76 age has been determined by scientists.

Humboldt State University researcher Allyson Carroll, an author of the study, said that previously researchers could not get the age of a standing tree from the ground, primarily because they cannot reach the center of the tree from the ground.

Using the core samples taken from higher up and a formula developed by the researchers, they can now determine a tree's age as well as its climate history, she said.

They're not likely to start barbecuing in the rainforest, but chimpanzees can understand the concept of cooking and are willing to postpone eating raw food, even carrying food some distance to cook it rather than eat immediately, scientists reported on Tuesday.

The findings, based on nine experiments conducted at the Tchimpounga Sanctuary in Republic of Congo and published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, suggest that chimps have all the brainpower needed to cook, including planning, causal understanding, and ability to postpone gratification.

They do lack the ability to produce fire. But if they were given a source of heat, chimps "might be quite able to manipulate (it) to cook," said developmental psychologist Felix Warneken of Harvard University, who conducted the study with Alexandra Rosati.

While the finding may seem esoteric, it lends support to the idea that cooking accelerated human evolution. Cooked food is easier to digest, spurring the growth of large brains in our australopithecine ancestors, Harvard's Richard Wrangham proposed about a decade ago.

If chimps have the cognitive skills to cook, australopithecines likely did, too, said Wrangham, who was not involved in the study: "It suggests that with a little extra brainpower, australopithecines could indeed have found a way to use fire to cook food."

Archaeological evidence suggests humans began using fire 1 million years ago.

Some of the experiments confirmed studies by other scientists, such as that chimps prefer seared sweet potatoes to raw. But those tests did not test whether chimps have the mental chops to cook.

Other tests did. For instance, the scientists presented chimps with two containers. One yielded cooked food through a false bottom, not actually cooking, and one did not.

The chimps learned that one transforms potatoes from raw to cooked. Given a choice of which device to put food in, they almost always opted for the "cooker," showing they understood and willingly waited for the raw-to-cooked transformation.

Chimps did not put pieces of wood that scientists gave them into the cooker, suggesting they grasped that only food can be cooked.

Surprisingly, since chimps usually eat food immediately, they were often willing to walk across a room to cook. When the first one did this, the scientists wondered if they had a single "chimpanzee genius," Warneken said. But others showed the same ability, understanding the idea of cooking and postponing gratification to do it.

There was no evidence, however, that they understood the concept of tipping.

PlanetiQ, a privately owned company, is beginning a key test intended to pave the way for the first commercial weather satellites.

The Bethesda, Maryland-based company is among a handful of startups designing commercial weather satellite networks, similar to what companies like DigitalGlobe, Planet Labs and Google Inc’s Skybox Imaging are undertaking in the sister commercial satellite industry of remote sensing.

“I think weather is the next big market,” PlanetiQ's chief executive and president, Anne Hale Miglarese, said. She estimates the global weather data industry at more than $6 billion.

Although there are already privately held companies that provide weather forecasting services, they rely on data from government-owned satellites.

PlanetiQ plans to fly the first two miniature satellites of a 12-member network next year. The satellites will be launched aboard a non-U.S. rocket and PlanetiQ will provide weather data in exchange for those flights, Miglarese said. She declined to disclose the company or agency providing the rocket launch. Another 10 PlanetiQ satellites are slated for launch in 2016.

PlanetiQ is building the science instrument at the heart of the satellites. The overall spacecraft manufacturer will be disclosed later this month, Miglarese said.

The satellites, which will weigh about 55 pounds (25 kg) each, will be positioned about 497 miles (800 km) above the planet and inclined about 72 degrees north and south of the equator. The satellites will track radio signals from the U.S. Global Positioning System, Russia’s Glasnoss, China’s BeiDou and Europe’s Galileo satellites as they pass through the atmosphere, relative to the PlanetiQ satellites' lines of sight.

The radio signals emitted by the navigation satellites change as they pass through different temperatures, pressures and levels of humidity in the atmosphere. The data can then be incorporated into computer programs that predict local and regional weather and that model changes in the global climate.

GeoOptics and Spire are two other startups planning to build and operate fleets of low-orbiting satellites equipped with so-called GPS radio occultation sensors. Two more startups, Tempus Global Data and HySpecIQ, intend to fly a different type technology, called hyperspectral imaging, to collect similar atmospheric data.

Bills currently pending before Congress would establish a pilot program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to buy weather data commercially, among other initiatives to help the nascent industry.

ST. LOUIS MISSOURI - Against all odds, Elizabeth Marek is alive thanks to a tumor-killing device that attacks brain cancer cells with electric fields. Marek has glioblastoma, a deadly and aggressive form of brain cancer with no cure and a life expectancy of just over two years.

Twenty-six weeks pregnant with her second child, 3 years after a small tumor was found in her brain, Marek began suffering from extreme headaches. She thought it was migraines due to pregnancy.    

"It ended up being a tumor that was the size of my fist on the left side of my brain and it was pushing the left brain into the right brain area," she said. 

A team of oncologists and surgeons at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri successfully removed the tumor during an emergency surgery and then waited 8 weeks to allow Marek's daughter more time in the womb before starting radiation and chemotherapy treatments. 

After the second round of chemotherapy, a new tumor started forming in Marek's brain. That is when Dr. George Ansstas offered her a chance to be a science experiment.

"I have always wanted to be in science. I didn't know I was going to be an experiment," Marek joked. 

Ansstas fitted Marek with a device called Optune, developed by U.S.-based oncology firm Novocure. A backpack feeds to an array of electrodes attached to Marek's head. Those electrodes create an electric field inside her brain which stops cell division in cancer cells. 

"There are highly charged particles in the cells that play a role in division and if you expose those cells to this electromagnetic field you might disrupt that process and lead cells to death," Ansstas explained.

In clinical trials the device, used in combination with conventional treatments, extended patients lives by an average of three months. 

"Also when we look at those patients at two years about 43 percent of those patients survive, that is something that has not been seen before," Ansstas added. 

43 percent compared to 29 percent with patients that didn't use the device during the trial period. The results of the trial are being presented this week at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. The device has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma. More than 2000 patients are currently using the device, according to Novocure.  

For Marek the results have been dramatic.

"The first time I got results back after using it for two weeks, I had a 30 percent reduction in my tumor size," she said. 

According to her doctors, Marek currently has no measurable signs of cancer in her brain. She has been wearing the device for a year and says apart from the odd looks, her life is back to normal.

"The only thing that is different about me is that I carry around a backpack that is putting electrodes into my brain. That way if little kids say 'oh what is that for, what is that for'  I say that's my battery for my brain," she said. 

There are no studies about the long term efficacy of her electric cancer fighter and in that sense Elizabeth is a pioneer, counting her blessings and enjoying her family one day at a time. In an effort to continue funding Elizabeth's treatment, the Marek family is collecting donations at www.gofundme.com/goelizabeth.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start smashing particles together at unprecedented speed on Wednesday, churning out data for the first time in more than two years that scientists hope might help crack the mystery of "dark matter".

The LHC, a 27 km (17 mile) underground complex near Geneva, will smash protons at 13 tera-electron-volts (TeV), almost twice the energy achieved in an initial three-year run that began in 2010. This proved the existence of the elusive Higgs boson particle, a discovery that produced two Nobel prizes in 2013.

Nobody knows quite what the LHC might reveal with its new particle collisions -- mini-versions of the Big Bang primordial blast that brought the universe into being 13.8 billion years ago -- but scientists hope it will produce evidence of what has been dubbed "new physics".

This concept includes "dark matter", thought to make up some 96 percent of the stuff of the universe while being totally invisible, and super-symmetry, or SUSY, under which all visible particles have unseen counterparts.

"The only thing we really know is that there is 'new physics' because the model that we have is not complete," said Luca Malgeri, a scientist working at the European physics research center CERN.

"It might be linked to dark matter or it might not. It might be linked to something totally new."

In a brief statement on Tuesday, CERN said the LHC would begin early on Wednesday morning "delivering physics data for the first time in 27 months".

If there is a particle missing from current knowledge of the building blocks of the universe, CERN scientists hope that it might be spotted, even fleetingly, in the debris of the billions of collisions, just as the Higgs boson was.

The first results might come early, Malgeri said, because the LHC already searched for smaller particles on its previous run, and a bigger particle might show up quickly, if high energy collisions are the key to its existence.

It may have extremely weak interaction with other forces, which might explain why it had never been observed before.

"MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION"

The CERN scientists would hope to detect any dark matter by noticing that some energy was missing after the collision, which would betray the existence of such a particle, Malgeri said.

If the hoped-for particle is only created very rarely, it may take many more collisions to find it, which is why the number of collisions - the LHC's "luminosity" - will increase over the next three years until it is 10 times brighter than on its first run.

Whether anything will be observed, however, is anybody's guess.

"This is the million dollar question," Malgeri said. "We are wide open. After the first run of the LHC, all possibilities are equally probable for new physics."

Scientists have documented in Florida a series of "virgin births," reproduction without mating, in a critically endangered sawfish species pushed to the brink of extinction by over-fishing and habitat destruction.

The scientists said on Monday it marks the first time the phenomenon called parthenogenesis has been seen in a vertebrate in the wild. Some females may be resorting to asexual reproduction because smalltooth sawfish numbers are so low mating opportunities may not exist, they said.

"There have been a number of cases in reptiles, birds and sharks of 'virgin birth' in captivity," Stony Brook University marine biologist Andrew Fields said. "This raises many questions about how common this mode of reproduction is in the wild."

In parthenogenesis, a female's egg cell can develop into a baby without being fertilized by a male's sperm cell.

In making an egg cell, a precursor cell divides into four cells. The one that eventually becomes the egg cell retains key cellular structures and the gel-like cytoplasm. The other three hold extra genetic material.

In parthenogenesis, one of those cells essentially acts as a sperm cell and fuses with the egg. This "fertilized" egg possesses about half the mother's genetic diversity, a trait allowing parthenogenesis to be detected through genetic testing.

Smalltooth sawfish are born and live for about three years in southwest Florida estuaries before moving into ocean coastal habitats.

The researchers were investigating sawfish inbreeding when they discovered seven, all healthy, born via parthenogenesis, about 3 percent of those examined.

"It really surprised us," said Kevin Feldheim, manager of the Pritzker Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Evolution at Chicago's Field Museum. "It is possible that numbers are so low that females have a hard time finding mates. In such a situation, parthenogenesis can be used as a last-ditch effort for a female to pass on her genes."

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission fish biologist Gregg Poulakis said the sawfish came from the Peace and Caloosahatchee rivers, which feed the Charlotte Harbor estuary system.

Sawfish, a type of ray, have a flattened shark-shaped body and a long, flat snout with pairs of teeth on the side used to find, stun and kill prey. They grow up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) long.

Their population collapse follows habitat loss and "unintentional" over-fishing, being caught in nets targeting other species. They received U.S. federal endangered species protection in 2003.

The research appears in the journal Current Biology.

Estonian company Terramil has begun manufacturing easy-to-instal mobile bomb shelters for those concerned about attack threats.

The manufacturers say they are light and easy to set up in any place, in a very short time -- although a digger is still needed.

An individual section of bomb shelter weighs about two tonnes. Its manufacturers say there is no need for any specific equipment or a crane to set up the shelter, other than a normal excavator as used on a building site.

"The installation of this certain unit here took about one hour and 30 minutes. And this started, time started from when we started unloading from the truck and this time stopped when everything was covered up and this was completely on place installed, covered and people are ready to go, so truck left," Terramil's Peeter Kirtsi said.

The main manufacturing material is plastic, but the shelter's creators refuse to reveal more detailed information on its components.

Despite its relative ease of transport and installation, the shelter still has to be dug in underground, demanding an appropriate location with an ample soil covering.

"It unites three different specific things that help this unit to stay bombproof. It means that the unit itself, the material of the unit, the profile that we have used here and also the soil cover. So this system interacts with the soil, and it... plays as one complete system in order to protect the people inside," Kirtsi added.

In the demonstration model, set up by Terramil in the Estonian armed forces' training ground, there are beds for 12 people, although clients can choose to alter the shelter module according to their own wishes -- for example, lessening the number of beds to equip the shelter with more amenities. It is also possible to add modules to consist of generators, refrigerators, staff storage and other necessities for emergency situations, up to the size of what Terramil equate to an underground town.

The manufacturers have tested the resistance to impact with the help of local armed forces and U.S. soldiers, who have both targeted the shelter with bombs during training. The nearest aviation shell exploded about four meters from the bomb shelter, which endured the blast.

"This two-meter depth unit was designed for 155-millimetre howitzer shells. We have tested it now against a range of different weapons, starting from mortars 81 mm and ending up with different howitzer classes and the biggest of them being 155 and as you can see there is no damage here. In order to get better results we have also had some local charges planted on top of the shelter and on the sides of the shelter and we have measuring equipment inside to measure the pressure, vibration, sound levels, everything like this that can be dangerous for people inside. And again we have had no damage to the shelter so far," Kirtsi said.

Terramil began selling the mobile bomb shelters this year, and say the interest they have received is vast, both from well-off locals and clients in the Middle East and beyond.

The demand for such shelters in Estonia has increased due to the crisis in Ukraine, although its creators point out that the project started long before the developments in the region.

"Every region where there is some crisis at hand or there is some potential danger... then you can just protect yourself and start developing these systems to hide away something to get the protective systems done. So basically every area where is some kind of danger," Kirtsi said.

"We have sold one of those to Estonia already. So there is a demand," he added.

The price of one 12-bunk, moderately equipped bomb shelter is about 18,000 euros (19,750 USD). Depending on the equipment and the number of modules, the price of a custom-designed bomb shelter would be considerably more.

For Easton LaChappelle, a 19-year-old from Colorado in the United States (U.S.), the difficulty with robotics has never been the technology itself - something he says he managed to master in a matter of months from his bedroom in his parent's house - but the cost.

The technology used by most robotic arms and hands on the market - and many more of those in development - typically comes with large overheads.

In the last five years, though, learning almost exclusively online in forums and emails, LaChappelle has managed to synthesize a series of robotic hands that could change industries and lives - and most of which cost just a few hundred dollars.

While other developments in countries like Austria and Argentina have pushed the boundaries of prosthetic offerings, helping those missing limbs to start to regain use of them with robotics, LaChappelle has done so using 3D printing.

And he's made one that he says can read your mind. It's called Anthromod.

"This reads right about 10 channels of the brain, so it kind of works kind of like a muscle sensor in that it picks up small electric discharges and turns that into something you can actually read within software, and then we actually track patterns and try and convert that into movement. So with this I'm actually able to change grips, grip patterns, based on facial gestures, and then use the raw actual brainwaves and focus to actually close the hand or open the clamp or hand," he told Reuters Television.

One of the most important aspects of the Anthromod design is the way in which it's controlled by the software, which LaChappelle says is different from the types of control that exist in other robotic platforms.

While it's the hand itself that moves, as more advanced controls are created it's the software that's doing the heavy lifting, using algorithms that make the arm easier to use.

"A good example is we actually had an amputee use the wireless brainwave headset to control a hand, and he was able to fluently control the robotic hand in right around about 10 minutes, so the learning curve is hardly a learning curve any more," he said.

The arms themselves might not look polished and ready for the shop floor - but LaChappelle sees them as cutting edge.

His robotic arms are all prototypes, each fulfilling a different need according to their design, with some using a wireless brainwave headset, designed more for prosthetic use. Another of his tele-robotic controlled hands was created with dangerous environments in mind, where human-like robots could be sent to allow people to monitor situations and intervene from afar.

"I really tried to make this as human-like as possible - this is probably about my fifth generation of the full robotic arm, and this is controlled using a full tele-robotic system, so there's actually a glove that you wear that tracks your hand movements, accelerometers to track your wrist and elbow, and then an IMU sensor as well to track your bicep rotation as well as your shoulder movement, and that gets all translated wirelessly to the robotic arm where it will copy what you do," he said.

One of the most impressive aspects of the arm is not the hardware itself, or even the software that controls it - but the fact that it can be 3D printed for a fraction of the cost of modern prosthetics.

This allows him to make complex internal structures to the designs which would otherwise be impossible, using not just any 3D printer, but precisely the kind many expect people to have at home in the near future.

"So 3D printing allows you to create something that's human-like, something that's extremely customized, again for a very low cost, which for certain applications such as prosthetics, is a really big part of it," he told Reuters.

"The full robotic arm is actually open source, and so people are now actually able to take this, reproduce it, and adapt it for different situations, applications, and really see what you can do with it," he added.

The Anthromod itself cost only about 600 dollars to make, LaChappelle said.

His work is documented in the videos he made at home, showing his handiwork - all part of his effort at making the invention open source - which means anyone can take his technology and customize and build on it.

The idea, he said, is not to create something that can solve problems for those with prostheses and other needs for robotic arms like the ones he's invented - but rather to create a platform that people around the world can use to customize their own versions of to suit their needs.

"A big reason we designed this on the consumer level is because we made this open source, we want someone that has a 3D printer, or very little printing experience, to be able to replicate this, to be able to use this for new applications, to be able to adapt it into new situations, so it's really exciting to see what people will start doing with something like this," he said.

"For the actual arm, we designed everything to be modular, meaning all the joints can actually interchange, and there's a universal bolt pattern. So you can now create something human-like, or you can create a big 20 degree freedom arm for complex filming or even low cost automations. So we really want to make a robotics platform, not so much just a robotics hand from this," he added.

LaChappelle hopes his efforts will contribute to developments in bomb defusal robots, heavy equipment and heavy industrial automation robotic arms, as well as exoskeletons.

A solar-powered plane attempting a round-the-world flight will cut short the seventh leg of its 35,000-km global (22,000-mile) journey, landing in Nagoya, western Japan, due to bad weather.

The plane will land at a small airport in Nagoya around midnight local time, one of the project's organisers told Reuters.

The Solar Impulse 2, a solar powered plane, left Nanjing, China on Sunday to fly over the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. The plane, which is covered in solar cells, took off from Abu Dhabi in March.

The journey across the Pacific Ocean was expected to be the most difficult stretch of the journey.

Overall, the trip was expected to span approximately 25 flight days broken up into 12 legs at speeds between 50 and 100 kph (30 to 60 mph).

Israeli medical experts have developed a wearable mobile monitor to keep a close watch on pregnant women and their fetuses as they go about their everyday lives.

The PregSense monitor has sensors woven into an elastic harness to provide data around the clock on the status of the fetus and the mother's health in the later stages of pregnancy.

A bluetooth-enabled device attached to the monitor collects and transmits data such as the mother and baby's heart rates to a smartphone and stores it on a secure cloud-based database accessible only to expectant mothers and their physicians.

The device is the work of the Nuvo Group, led by Oren Oz. He says a smartphone app will eventually provide a visual representation of the data gathered by the wearable monitor.

"Now you can see both you and the baby, the heart and all the data. What you are going to get in the app eventually is visualization that can tell you where the hand is, you're going to see if the baby is awake, you can hear your baby's heartbeat anytime you want and obviously everything about you as the mom, the activity, if you are relaxed, how you sleep, your activity, your heart activity, everything about your pregnancy will be put into data," he explained as he demonstrated the device for mother-to-be, Michal.

Oz founded the Nuvo Group with another pregnancy technological innovation, Ritmo, a strap allowing mothers to stream soothing music from a smartphone to gently stimulate the fetus.

The Israeli tech firm hopes the device will reassure anxious mothers like Michal, in week 32 of her pregnancy, who require monitoring without having to see her doctor.

"It connects me a lot more with the fetus, I'll hear the fetus whenever I want and it will be easier for me. I also won't have to be dependent on a doctor, at any given time I'll be able to connect, to see and hear," Michal said.

The PregSense strap is designed to collect data to help physicians detect symptoms that may lead to complications in pregnancy earlier.

"It's the first time that you have a huge amount of data of women and babies together about heart rate, kickings, position for fetus etc and we will be able to analyze this data to predict about events of pregnancy, like pre-term labor like pre-eclampsia and more and we will be able to intervene in the right time," said Varda Shalev, a medical informatics expert and active care primary physician. She is an external consultant to the Tel Aviv-based Nuvo Group.

The PregSense monitor does not use ultrasound like traditional doppler devices, which require pregnant women to lie still while physicians manually track the heartbeat of the fetus. The sensors use a patented algorithm to filter the signals it picks up into two heartbeat recordings.

Its developers say the passive sensors avoid the potential harm to tissue posed by ultrasonic devices and is perfectly safe for both the mother and baby during continuous monitoring.

The data collected is of high enough quality to be useful for clinicians and researchers.

"The sophistication of the technology and the sophistication of the sensors that we had designed for that is really making what used to be clinical data collection into passive continuous reliable home data collection," said Professor Nathan Intrator, a bio signal expert and chief technology officer for Nuvo Group . 

Nuvo Group's advisory board member Professor Simcha Yagel, who also heads the division of obstetrics and gynecology at Hadassah, Hebrew University Medical Centers, said the electrocardiogram (ECG) provides the added value to the device.        

"I think the new achievement of Nuvo is in the field of detection of the ECG traces of the fetus, not only the sound not only the ultrasound but truly an electronic ECG," he told Reuters during a routine ultrasound scan for a pregnant woman in hospital.

Oz said doctors would appreciate not having to use traditional heavy machinery, such as the cardiotocography (CTG) or electronic fetal monitor (EFM) machines to trace the fetal heartbeat. Instead, they could track and diagnose patients remotely, allowing quick detection and intervention.

"The immediate impact, the immediate benefit to doctors is that we are replacing the bulky CTG machines which are heavy  and connected to the wall with the light weight mobility and continuous monitoring." said Oz.

The consumer version of the product, known as Ritmo Beats, is to be launched for users by the end of 2015 and will cost around $250 USD, Oz said. The clinical grade FDA-regulated device, to be teamed with a group of physicians to monitor the data and alert the mother of any unexpected events, has a 2016 launch target.

Oz is certain his invention will change pregnancy care management and "bring better care to more women at a fraction of the cost".

Agility ladders, a staple of sports training when victory can hang on the athlete's ability to turn quickly, have moved into mainstream gyms where fitness experts say they are helping everyday exercisers be nimble and quick.

Jumping, running, marching and hopscotching through the grids on the floor have become an added feature in personal training and group fitness classes.

Will Elson, personal training manager at New York Health and Racquet Club in New York City, said the ladders also make a great addition to circuit training and can help to strengthen joints, ligaments and tendons while elevating the heart rate.

“It boosts cardio with fast foot strikes and knee lifts, while incorporating balance and joint stability,” said Elson. “It also has the benefits of working on coordination. And it’s fun in a confined space.”

Agility is the ability to change the body's position quickly, efficiently and with control. A study in the December 2013 issue of the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that agility training can also enhance cognitive skills, such as memory and vigilance.

Elson likens agility training to learning a new language.

"It’s a great exercise to force someone to focus, to learn a movement pattern and be able to execute it without looking down,” he said. “The body is learning something new.”

Jonathan Ross, spokesperson for the American Council on Exercise, believes agility training is also a valuable skill for non-athletes.

“It actually develops eye-foot coordination where you’re able to move through a discretely defined space,” explained the Washington D.C.-based trainer and author of “Abs Revealed.”

“Most people don’t target foot placement,” he added. “Most people will look down but in sports you can’t be looking down. You have to focus upward."

Foot drills on agility ladders can range from simple walking between rungs to complex skipping of spaces and sideways shuffles. But Ross suggests conquering two or three basic drills before tackling new ones.

“A common mistake is going too quick too soon,” he said. “It’s like riding a bike. People get nervous about making a mistake but it’s not that difficult to learn as long as they don’t get too stuck in their own head.”

Elson also warned that all agility ladders are not same and there is no standard size.

"One needs to take into account the height of the person and the size of the boxes,” he said.

Dinosaurs, those bygone masters of the planet, were warm-blooded just like today's mammals, according to a scientist who judged their metabolism using body mass and growth rates deduced from fossils of species including Tyrannosaurus rex.

Paleontologist Michael D'Emic of Stony Brook University in New York took issue with the conclusion of other researchers last year that dinosaurs were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded, but had a metabolism somewhere in between.

Scientists have debated since the 19th century whether dinosaurs were slow, lumbering, cold-blooded creatures, as originally thought, or boasted a more warm-blooded physiology allowing for a vigorous lifestyle.

"The main point of my study is that the dinosaurs that have been studied so far were on average as warm-blooded as mammals living today," said D'Emic, who argued that the 2014 study under-estimated dinosaur growth rates and should have analyzed dinosaurs statistically within the same group as today's birds.

Birds, which evolved from small feathered dinosaurs roughly 150 million years ago, are warm-blooded.

The researchers in last year's study evaluated the metabolism of 21 dinosaur species using a formula based on their body mass, as revealed by the bulk of their thigh bones, and their growth rates, indicated by growth rings in fossil bones akin to those in trees. The species included predators like T. rex, long-necked and duckbilled plant-eaters and others.

They compared this information to data on living mammals, birds, fish and reptiles.

D'Emic re-analyzed the same data to reach his conclusions, published in the journal Science.

The authors of last year's study on Thursday disputed D'Emic's conclusions. "We disagree with his central criticisms and we emphasize that all of our original conclusions stand," said University of New Mexico biologist John Grady.

"Comparing dinosaur growth with the observed growth rate of living vertebrates clearly shows that non-avian dinosaurs were mesotherms," added Grady, using the term for an intermediate metabolism.

Warm-blooded land animals like mammals and birds have never achieved the size of the biggest dinosaurs. But D'Emic said merely being warm-blooded would not have prevented dinosaurs from getting large although they may have needed adaptations to prevent their huge bodies from over-heating.

"The Earth was generally warmer during the time of the dinosaurs, and so overheating could have been a problem for them. However, most large dinosaurs had some hollow, air-filled bones in their skeleton and likely had large air sacs in other parts of their bodies, just like birds today," D'Emic said.

This provided a "natural ventilation system" within their bodies that helped to keep them cool, D'Emic said.

Amid evidence of fraud in a high-profile study on how canvassers can convince people to back same-sex marriage, the journal Science, which published the study, retracted it on Thursday.

The senior author agreed to the retraction, Science editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt said in a statement on the journal's website. The graduate student accused of making up data, lying about funding and other violations has not.

The study, which received widespread coverage when it was published, tested a longstanding theory in social science that contact with targets of prejudice can reduce intolerance.

Specifically, the study examined whether door-to-door canvassers who identify as gay can convince people to support same-sex marriage and do so more effectively than heterosexual canvassers.

The authors, UCLA graduate student Michael LaCour and Columbia University political scientist Donald Green, concluded that canvassers who tell voters that they are gay can indeed change minds on same-sex marriage. That result, the authors said, was based on a survey of some 9,500 people in California.

When other scientists were unable to replicate key aspects of the study, they began digging into it, including contacting the polling company that reportedly did the 9,500-person survey.

The firm, Qualtrics, claimed it "had no familiarity with the project" and "denied having the capabilities to perform many aspects" of the survey LaCour and Green described, graduate students David Brockman and Joshua Kalla of the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in a timeline they posted online.

In her retraction notice, McNutt said that the Green and LaCour paper had lied about paying people to participate in the supposed survey, lied about being funded by prominent groups including the Ford Foundation and failed to produce the original data it was based on.

Last week Green asked that the paper be retracted, telling Science in a letter that he was "deeply embarrassed by this turn of events and apologize to the editors, reviewers, and readers" of the journal.

LaCour has not agreed to have the paper retracted, McNutt said. He has said he stands by the reported findings and told the Retraction Watch blog last week that he "will supply a definitive response" to the allegations and is "gather(ing) evidence and relevant information."

Pittsburgh, Pensylvania - Researchers have taken their serpentine machines, developed over decades at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, and connected them to a central hub to create one of the most robust robots ever developed. Its creators have named it the Snake Monster. 

At the technology's core, says robotics professor Howie Choset, are modules which connect to each other, allowing researchers to easily assemble and program task-specific robots in minutes. 

"These modules that we have designed and other modules to be designed, they are like a smart Lego set. We are able to put the modules together as easy as Lego, but there is a lot going on underneath the hood to allow that to happen," Choset said. 

Each module has the computing power to control the entire robot. The pieces can be screwed together to form machines of various sizes and functionality. Once connected the modules communicate via ethernet.

Choset says robots that can be easily assembled could potentially have a huge impact on how search and rescue operations are carried out in the future. He imagines a snake monster robot walking over rubble in a disaster zone, using its wheels to roll down a hill and then one of its legs to slither into a damaged building to search for survivors.

While the ultimate goal is to program these machines to work autonomously, Choset says humans will be able to control them using a robotic twin which will give an operator a 'hands on' interface to control the robot remotely.           "We built a force feedback master slave arm where the master controls one robot and the slave moves as the master requires," Choset said, adding that the tasks these types of robots can perform are only limited to what developers can dream up to task them with. The Snake Monster can take a beating as well. 

"That robot is field deployable. You can take that robot and throw it around, it's robust. You can kick it and it is still going to work," said Choset. 

To test how quickly these modular robots can be assembled and programmed, one member of the team built and programmed one to feed him lunch. The entire process took less than 20 minutes, a delicious result for a robot with massive potential.

Scientists battling a bee-killing disease are about to start testing a new weapon -- a sun-heated hive designed by a Czech high school teacher.

Roman Linhart told Reuters he had secured a patent for his invention after 10 years of research into ways of wiping out varroosis disease, which has been destroying bee colonies across the world.

The stakes are high, as the death of bees threatens harvests which rely on the insects for pollination.

The teacher at Chrudim's Secondary School of Agriculture, 120 km (75 miles) east from Prague, joins a line-up of experts who have been trying to find an efficient way to tackle the condition for decades.

Experts from Czech Republic's Palacky University said they were about to start trialing Linhart's method -- which aims to kill the Varroa destructor parasite responsible for the disease by heating up hives to 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and higher.

"Scientific probes will be performed in the summer. Some beekeepers have tested the method and it had the declared parameters," said Professor Vitezslav Bicik, of the university's zoology department.

Bee keepers have tried using heat before. But their efforts have been hampered by difficulties in powering the heating units in often remote locations and making sure the bees themselves are not harmed by the high temperatures.

Up to now they have often resorted to removing the entire population before heating the hive, a tricky and time-consuming procedure.

Linhart, a bee keeper himself, said he got round the problems by using just the power of the sun for his thermosolar hive, and a technique that heats the hive through the glass top for about two hours.

According to the plans, the heat slowly builds up in black-painted metal sheets inside the insulated hive, paralyzing, sterilizing and eventually killing the mites but leaving the bees unharmed.

"With this, you can take 100 hives, or as many as you have, and work simultaneously on all of them," Linhart said.

This 430,000-year-old case may be the world's oldest murder mystery.

Scientists on Wednesday said a fossilized skull discovered deep inside a Spanish cave shows telltale signs of homicide: two fractures inflicted by the same weapon.

The skull, belonging to a primitive member of the Neanderthal lineage, was found in an apparent funerary site down a shaft in the appropriately bleak-sounding Sima de los Huesos, Spanish for "Pit of the Bones," in the Atapuerca mountains.

The skull shows that our species, Homo sapiens, cannot claim a monopoly on murder.

"This individual was killed in an act of lethal interpersonal violence, providing a window into an often-invisible aspect of the social life of our human ancestors," said paleontologist Nohemi Sala of Madrid's Centro Mixto UCM-ISCIII de Evolución y Comportamiento Humano.

This oldest-known example of murder occurred 230,000 years before our species first appeared in Africa.

"Based on the similarities in shape and size of both the wounds, we believe they are the result of repeated blows with the same object and inflicted by another individual, perhaps in a face-to-face encounter," Sala added.

Remains of nearly 30 individuals were found at the bottom of the 43-foot (13-meter) shaft.

The murder victim suffered two penetrating fractures on the forehead's left side, above the eye. Using forensic methods like those employed by police, the researchers interpreted the wounds, each nearly an inch (2 cm) wide, as evidence of blunt-force trauma occurring around the time of death.

"We have examined the bone microscopically and used CT scans," added paleontologist Juan Luis Arsuaga of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Sala said the weapon may have been a wooden spear, stone spear tip or stone hand-axe.

The presence of a notch at a similar location in the outlines of both fractures indicates they were caused by the same object. "Since either of these wounds would likely have been lethal, penetrating the brain, the presence of multiple wounds implies an intention to kill," Sala said.

Arsuaga said the victim was a young adult. Whether it was a man or woman is not clear.

The motive and perpetrator are unlikely ever to be known.

"Unfortunately, the intentions do not fossilize, so it is impossible to interpret the motivation of the killing," Sala said. "Not even Sherlock Holmes could help us in that."

The research appears in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.

The U.S. Air Force on Tuesday said it has certified privately held SpaceX to launch U.S. military and spy satellites, ending a monopoly held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, since its creation in 2006.

The decision follows two years of discussions, reviews and legal disputes between the U.S. Air Force and Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX, and means the company founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, can compete for national security launches with its Falcon 9 rocket.

"SpaceX's emergence as a viable commercial launch provider provides the opportunity to compete launch services for the first time in almost a decade," Air Force Secretary Deborah James said in a statement.

Leveraging SpaceX's investment in an alternate launch vehicle would help drive down the cost and help improve the U.S. military's resiliency, James said.

SpaceX's first opportunity to compete against ULA would come in June, when the Air Force said it expects to kick off a competition for launches of additional Global Positioning System III satellites built by Lockheed.

The certification, initially expected last December, followed two years of intensive reviews by the Air Force and SpaceX, which already has won significant contracts with NASA to launch cargo and crews to the International Space Station.

The Air Force said it spent more than $60 million and dedicated 150 people to the effort, which included 2,800 discreet tasks, three certification flight demonstrations, 21 major subsystem reviews and 700 audits aimed at establishing a technical baseline for future flight worthiness determinations.

Musk called the decision "an important step toward bringing competition to national security space launch."

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said he hoped SpaceX's certification would bring down what he called "unjustifiably high" launch costs and end U.S. reliance on Russian-built RD-180 engines that power ULA's Atlas 5 rocket.

The U.S. Congress has banned the use of Russian engines for national security launches after 2019. It passed the law after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region last year.

James called the news "an important milestone" for the Air Force and the Pentagon. An independent review in March cited a "stark disconnect" between the two sides about the purpose of the certification process, and said the Air Force's approach had stifled the very competition it was seeking to promote.

SpaceX had shocked Air Force officials when it filed a lawsuit in April 2014 to protest its decision to award 36 rocket launches to ULA while delaying competition for 14 contracts that were meant to be open to competition.

The company dropped its lawsuit in January after the two sides agreed to work collaboratively to wrap up the certification process.

The White House said on Tuesday the ethical issues associated with gene-editing on the human genome need further study by the scientific community and should not be pursued until issues are resolved.

"The administration believes that altering the human germline for clinical purposes is a line that should not be crossed at this time," John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement.

The technology, which has the potential to create "designer babies," ignited an outcry from scientists last month when it was used in China to alter the DNA of human embryos.

"Research along these lines raises serious and urgent questions about the potential implications for clinical applications that could lead to genetically altered humans," Holdren said in the statement on the White House website.

"The full implications of such a step could not be known until a number of generations had inherited the genetic changes made - and choices made in one country could affect all of us," he said.

The National Academy of Sciences said last week it would convene an international summit this fall to explore the ethical and policy issues associated with the research and appoint an international committee to recommend guidelines for the technology.

The White House supports the review, Holdren said.

Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took to the social media site on Wednesday to say she felt "thirty years sadder" after the 30-day mourning period she observed following her husband's sudden death.

Sandberg's husband, SurveyMonkey Chief Executive Dave Goldberg, died on May 1 after falling off a treadmill during a vacation in Mexico.

Sandberg posted an online tribute four days after the death of Goldberg, who built a company valued at $2 billion. She has also periodically shared posts about her mourning and pictures of Goldberg.

Her 1,731-word post Wednesday marked the end of sheloshim, the traditional Jewish 30-day period of mourning for a spouse.

"I have lived thirty years in these thirty days," Sandberg wrote. "I am thirty years sadder. I feel like I am thirty years wiser."

Sandberg also said Goldberg's death helped her gain a "more profound understanding of what it is to be a mother," and that she rejoiced that her children were alive each day.

She ended the post with lyrics from Bono, who sang at Goldberg's Silicon Valley memorial service last month.

"'There is no end to grief ... and there is no end to love,'" she posted. "I love you, Dave."

New York state issued on Wednesday extensive new rules for companies that operate in virtual currencies such as bitcoin but did little to accommodate complaints that overly tight regulation could hamper the nascent industry.

The new rules, the first by a state, create comprehensive guidelines for regulating digital currency firms, according to the state's Department of Financial Services, which developed the regulations.

It means that digital currency companies operating in New York state that hold customer funds and exchange virtual currencies for dollars or other currencies are required to apply for what is known as a state "BitLicense."

"There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is entrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a license from the state to do so, it accepts the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer's money does not just disappear into a black hole," Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York state regulator, said in a speech Wednesday at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington.

The "BitLicense" rules include consumer protection, anti-money laundering and cybersecurity protections.

The regulations come as digital currencies have drawn criticism for attracting drug dealers and other criminal elements, while failing to safeguarding consumer funds.

Last year, bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsed after it claimed to have lost $500 million worth of customer bitcoins after being hacked.

Overall, industry participants said New York's new rules are still problematic but nonetheless an improvement over the original proposals laid out in July and revised in December.

Digital currency companies are required to obtain prior approval for material changes to their products or business models, such as wallet firms offering exchange services. They would also need approval for new controlling investors.

But they would not need approval from the state for every round of venture capital funding or standard software updates.

"We have no interest in micro-managing minor app updates. We're not Apple," said Lawsky.

Companies that want both a BitLicense and a money transmitter license can work with the state regulator to have a "one-stop" application submission to cover the requirements for both.

Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit research group Coin Center, called the final regulations "far from perfect," specifically citing what he said were vague state-level anti-money laundering obligations that go beyond federal regulations.

He said the group was working with other states "to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes made here."

The rules do not apply to software developers, individual users, customer loyalty programs, gift cards, currency miners, or merchants accepting bitcoin as payment.

Lawsky, meanwhile, has come under fire from the bitcoin community for issuing the rules shortly after announcing he was leaving the agency to set up a consulting company that will advise companies on financial matters that could possibly include digital currencies.

The most prominent virtual currency now is bitcoin, often used as an investment or to pay for goods and services online.

Bitcoin prices have been steady of late, at $225.77 on the BitStamp platform on Wednesday. The price rose as high as $1,123 in December 2013.

"I think (the rules) are going to increase the costs to entry for businesses," said New York attorney Reuben Grinberg, who specializes in virtual currency. "But I think it's going to give consumers greater peace of mind and will end up promoting investment in this area much more so than it hurts."

Yahoo Inc will broadcast the Oct. 25 National Football League game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars in London in the first live-stream of an NFL game.

The International Series game will be streamed exclusively free of charge on Yahoo sites including Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Screen and Tumblr, Yahoo and the NFL said on Wednesday.

Yahoo and the NFL did not disclose terms of the deal.

Technology news site Re/code, however, reported that Yahoo paid at least $20 million for the streaming rights, citing industry executives familiar with the negotiations.

Yahoo will have exclusive advertising rights to the game, which will also be available in a 30-minute on-demand version, Senior Vice President of product and engineering Adam Cahan said in an interview.

The on-demand version will include commercials that viewers would not be able to skip.

Yahoo was hopeful of more such partnerships in the future, Cahan said. The company has been trying to fight stalling revenue growth by turning towards video ads as its once-hot Web portal and email service lag those of rivals such as Google Inc.

It bought automated advertising service BrightRoll for $640 million in November, saying the deal would make its video ad platform the largest in the United States.

The Oct. 25 game will also be telecast in the Buffalo (WIVB-TV) and Jacksonville (WTEV-TV) markets.

A decision on whether the NFL will partner with streaming service providers for future games has not been made, spokesman Alex Reithmiller said.

"This is a first step ... taking this first step is a signal that there will probably be other steps to come," he said.

Three Google Inc (GOOGL.O) compensation committee members were re-elected on Wednesday, the technology company said at its annual meeting, despite a challenge from a high-profile proxy adviser that raised concerns over executive pay.

Google did not immediately detail by how much of a margin the directors won re-election at the meeting, which was webcast. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended that Google shareholders withhold votes for the three directors, saying "mega grants" provided to Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and Chief Business Officer Omid Kordestani were "problematic."

ISS recommended that votes be withheld for Google compensation committee members John Doerr, Paul Otellini and Ram Shriram. ISS also recommended investors withhold votes from Google director John Hennessy, president of Stanford University, citing what it said is his role as a non-independent member of the board's nominating committee.

The recommendations were unusual for ISS, which urged votes against directors at S&P 500 companies only 3 percent of the time in 2014.

Google said all its director candidates won election. Several shareholder proposals were also defeated at the meeting, Google said, including proposals to require a majority vote standard for the election of directors and to report on the costs of renewable energy investments.

Google awarded Schmidt $100 million in restricted stock units last year - the second time in less than three years that the company's former CEO has received an equity award of that size.

Kordestani, who was re-hired in October to become chief business officer, received a $60 million equity award and a one-time $65 million supplemental equity award.

He also received a sign-on bonus of $5 million.

ISS, in a report seen by Reuters, said the generous executive pay packages lacked a measurable connection to company performance goals.

However, Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said investors would not likely be swayed by ISS' recommendation.

"Governance issues, unfortunately, as important as they should be, rarely resonate with the investment community. It has to be truly extreme to matter," Wieser said.

ISS recommended in April that DuPont (DD.N) investors vote in favor of activist investor Nelson Peltz joining the board. But shareholders ended up backing all 12 directors nominated by the company.

At Google, ISS wrote that "Although ISS has not identified any major issues regarding the structure of Google's executive compensation in past years, the magnitude of total pay provided to certain executives, paired with a lack of performance criteria and compelling rationale, raises significant concerns."

Schmidt, who focuses on government outreach and deals in his role as executive chairman, handed the CEO reins to Google co-founder Larry Page in 2011.

Page and fellow co-founder Sergey Brin both have a base salary of $1 and no other compensation. Most of their wealth comes from their holdings of Google shares.

Kordestani previously worked with Google as senior vice president of global sales and business development from May 1999 to April 2009.

The chief business officer is considered a key position, overseeing all the company's revenue-generating activities and serving as a liaison to investors and Wall Street.

Google shares were little changed at $554.05 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

Apple Inc said it is recalling some Beats Pill XL portable wireless speakers due to a fire hazard caused by overheating batteries.

The iPhone maker will recall about 222,000 speakers in the United States and about 11,000 in Canada, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said on Wednesday.

Apple has received eight reports of overheating speakers, the CPSC said in a statement.

The company did not disclose the number of speakers affected by the recall or the number of complaints it received, but said the recall does not affect any other Beats or Apple products.

Apple said it will issue store credit or a refund worth $325 within about three weeks of receiving the faulty speakers, which were introduced by Beats in November 2013.

Apple agreed to buy Beats for about $3 billion in May 2014 in an effort to jump-start an uneven attempt to make headway in music streaming as iTunes sales were declining.

This is not the first time that Apple has had to recall products.

The company had launched an iPhone replacement program in August last year after admitting some smartphones sold between September 2012 and January 2013 had faulty batteries. (apple.co/1uBotvd)

In 2011, network connectivity issues had forced Apple to recall some iPad2 tablets that were designed to run on Verizon's network. (reut.rs/1G5PQUs)

The Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that it would place a higher priority on integrating drones into the national air space by appointing a senior adviser to coordinate relations with industry and other outside stakeholders.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the new position would deal with "an absolute crush" of outside interest from the private sector and allow regulators within the agency's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) integration office to concentrate on crafting new regulations for commercial drone use.

He said the aim was to put "more resources" on drone integration "to elevate its profile within the agency."

The job, which has not yet been filled, is the latest FAA action to enhance its accommodation of commercial drones in the face of mounting pressure from Congress and private industry.

The FAA, which hopes to have final regulations in place by the start of 2017, has also taken steps to broaden the corporate use of drones on a case-by-case basis.

“It’s almost an external focus on how we can ensure that we’re being responsive to industry and the global community, while at the same time actually getting the work done that’s getting things into the air space system,” Huerta told reporters.

The Small UAV Coalition, which includes e-commerce companies Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O), said the change could further expedite FAA movement on commercial drones.

"Elevating and more fully resourcing the UAS industry at the FAA is long overdue but a welcome recognition," said coalition executive director Michael Drobac.

The change essentially splits in two the position of former FAA drone office manager James Williams, who recently retired.

The new senior UAS adviser will report to FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker and have broad scope to deal with the public, the aviation industry, state and local governments, members of Congress and others.

A job posting for the senior adviser's position, which closed May 29, included a salary range of $123,700 to $174,200.

Williams' regulatory duties will also be elevated within FAA. The new drone office director, who has yet to be named, will report to Margaret Gilligan, associate FAA administrator for aviation safety. Williams reported instead to the agency's flight standards director.

Huerta told reporters that the UAS integration office will retain its concentration on rulemaking and the granting of interim exemptions from a near-ban on commercial drones.

India asked unregistered web-based taxi services to halt operations in December after a driver contracted with Uber was accused of rape. Both Uber and Ola applied for licences in New Delhi but kept operating while approvals were pending.

In March, New Delhi asked the companies to stop if they want their licenses to be processed. The applications were rejected on Wednesday because the companies failed to comply, transport official S. Biswas Roy told Reuters.

"They will have to resubmit (new) license applications now," Roy said.

"We will still insist they comply with the ban order first, otherwise they can go to the court," he said.

A spokesman for Ola, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Corp, declined to comment. Uber said the license rejection was 'unfortunate'.

It was still possible to book a taxi using mobile applications of Uber or Ola in New Delhi late on Wednesday.

Earlier this week, a driver contracted with Uber was arrested near New Delhi after a woman passenger accused him of sexual harassment when she hailed his cab. The driver was later released on bail.

Medications-by-mail company PillPack said it had raised $50 million in funding, underscoring the continuing appeal of healthcare companies to venture capital backers.

PillPack is taking on established U.S. pharmacies such as CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, betting its tweaks, such as delivering rolls of individual-dose packs labeled by time and date, will help it win convenience-focused customers.

While technology has helped simplify other types of services and purchases, entrepreneurs have largely overlooked the pharmacy market, said George Zachary, a partner at Charles River Ventures, who led the funding round and will take a seat on PillPack's board.

Retail prescription drug sales in the U.S. last year totaled $259 billion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research organization.

Some 15 percent of prescriptions are filled via mail order, including from the pharmacy giants, PillPack Chief Executive TJ Parker said in an interview on Tuesday. While his company is exclusively mail-order for now, it expects to open retail locations later this year.

Trends such as the aging baby-boomer generation and national health-care reform are leading to increased spending on medicine, which in turn is drawing increased interest from financial backers.

Last quarter, life sciences drew $2.2 billion in venture backing, according to the National Venture Capital Association. That placed it second only to the software sector, with almost a one-third increase from $1.69 billion in the same quarter of 2014.

Accel Partners, Atlas Venture (CQ), Menlo Ventures, and Sherpa Ventures also participated in the funding round. Boston-based Pillpack was founded two years ago and launched last year.

The last time Hillary Clinton ran for the White House in 2008, Aaron Levie was too busy building his start-up company to pay much attention to politics.

But earlier this year, the 30-year-old Levie led his company, Box, through an initial public offering, helping free a small portion of his time to support the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. A few weeks ago, Levie, whose company is worth more than $2 billion, agreed to host a fundraiser for Clinton.

He sees big stakes for the tech sector in this election, Levie told Reuters, on issues ranging from improving the patent system to securing visas for foreign workers and limiting government surveillance.

“There’s more intersection between the technology industry and policy than ever before,” said Levie, whose trademark mad-scientist hair showed signs of gray, countered by youthful bright orange sneakers. He said he was backing Clinton because Democrats' social policies, for example on marriage equality, resonated more with him than Republican ones.

The campaigns of various White House hopefuls are looking to reel in the younger Silicon Valley influencers like Levie who could help raise some money for their candidates and also bring along some of the tech sector’s energy and cachet.

Levie, whose company helps store data remotely in the “cloud,” is among several young Silicon Valley executives Clinton’s campaign has been courting.

"Young, innovative entrepreneurs are key to growing and strengthening our economy," said a Clinton campaign spokesman.

SILICON VALLEY A CHALLENGE

But recruiting tech entrepreneurs can prove a challenge. Many lack enthusiasm for politics. For example, in April venture capitalist Marc Andreessen told Fortune he was "struggling between the anti-science party and the anti-economics party" and felt tempted to sit out the next election.

Fundraising officials who declined to be named said they hoped the imprimatur of a few will make it easier to attract others, and Democrats have a long list of prospects.

“The next crowd is Twitter, Facebook, Airbnb," said venture capitalist Steve Westly, who served on President Barack Obama’s national finance committee during the 2008 election. While some of those companies have been around for years, many of their employees are relatively new to their wealth.

Twitter and Airbnb representatives didn't respond to requests for comment. A Facebook spokesman declined comment.

Many in Silicon Valley gravitate toward Democrats, because the party is seen as more in sync with the tech community on social issues such as gay marriage. But Republican 2016 hopefuls such as Kentucky Senator Rand Paul are trying to woo the technorati on economic and regulatory issues. A packed room of start-up workers at his San Francisco office opening last month suggested he may be having some success.

Some big names in technology are already involved in politics. Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo is a longstanding Democratic donor, while Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg gives to candidates of both parties.

COLLEGE DROPOUT

Levie said he has donated only once to a candidate, Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York. He still hasn’t registered to vote in California, his home for almost a decade, relying instead on his parents to forward him his ballot from Washington state.

A dropout from the University of Southern California, Levie founded Box with some friends and ran it for a time out of his uncle’s garage near San Francisco before landing hundreds of millions in venture capital backing.

Friends and business associates such as Emanuel Yekutiel, deputy finance director for Clinton, helped spark his interest in her campaign, Levie said.

The clincher: a May 1 meeting in Palo Alto where Clinton campaign officials, including chief technology officer and former Google executive Stephanie Hannon, met with about 50 executives and venture capitalists and highlighted the importance of building a cash reserve for the campaign.

Among the invitees: Palmer Luckey, the 22-year-old co-founder of Oculus Rift, a virtual-reality company bought last year by Facebook for $2 billion, according to someone involved in the event.

Though Levie says campaign support will take a backseat to running Box, he weighs in on election issues with vigor.

Last month, he criticized Rand Paul on Twitter over his comments at a congressional hearing where he compared the “right to healthcare” to the enslaving of doctors.

"Dude, you should be a script writer for `The Hunger Games`, not running for President," Levie wrote on Twitter, referring to the movie about death matches in a dystopian, ruthless society.

Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd will invest in financial media outlet China Business Network in a deal set to be announced on Thursday, Chinese media reported on Wednesday.

The investment in China Business Network, part of Shanghai Media Group (SMG), will be worth more than 1 billion yuan ($161 million), said Sina.com, Sohu.com and QQ.com, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter and unnamed people at Alibaba.

Two people with knowledge of the deal, who weren't authorised to speak to media, told Reuters an investment could be announced as soon as Thursday, but did not know the financial details.

An Alibaba spokeswoman declined comment. SMG and China Business Network were not immediately available for comment outside normal business hours.

A stake in a financial media outlet could help round out Alibaba founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma's already extensive holdings in China's financial industry. His aim is to build an array of online services to challenge the country's state-owned banks and other institutions in the sector.

These holdings have been acquired through various companies of Ma's and include Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba which operates China's biggest online payment processing service.

Investments by Ma or his companies can send their targets' shares skyrocketing. On Monday, Reorient Group Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed financial services provider, nearly tripled in value after a fund backed by the billionaire agreed to invest HK$2.7 billion ($348 million) for a controlling stake.

Alibaba's investment in China Business Network would not be the first partnership between Ma and SMG in financial information services.

Last November, Ant and SMG said they would jointly invest 390 million yuan in Shanghai Gildata Inc, a subsidiary of financial software firm Hundsun Technologies Inc. Shanghai Gildata is a data services provider that competes with Thomson Reuters Corp and Bloomberg L.P.

Ma had previously invested 3.3 billion yuan to take a controlling interest in Hundsun.

Sophos Group Plc, a maker of IT security products, said it plans to raise about $100 million in an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange.

The company, which expects admission of its shares in early July, had pulled out from potential floats in 2007 and 2009.

"We think the atmosphere for technology companies in the UK is strong, and is only getting stronger," Chief Executive Kris Hagerman said on a conference call on Wednesday.

He declined to comment on the expected valuation of the potential floatation.

Sophos, majority-owned by Apax Partners LLP, however, said it expects to have a free float of at least 25 percent after its admission on the FTSE-250 index.

Apax Partners was aiming at listing the business at 1 billion pounds ($1.53 billion), the Telegraph reported in February. (bit.ly/17awpM1)

Sophos, which primarily focuses on mid-market enterprises with 100-5,000 employees, plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt, which stood at $318.8 million at April-end.

J.P. Morgan Securities Plc and Morgan Stanley & Co International Plc are acting as joint global co-ordinators for the offering.

NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Indian government has launched a "Lost and Found" website to help families trace the tens of thousands of children in the country who go missing every year - often abducted for forced labor or sexual exploitation - and are never found.

The "Khoya Paya", or "Lost and Found", website khoyapaya.gov.in was launched by India's Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, who said the portal would allow parents to register details of missing children and citizens to report sightings.

The information will be shared in real time with police and state authorities, who are mandated to register the complaint and investigate the case.

"It was felt that we could have this portal, where if a child goes missing, families can put the details and the picture onto Khoya Paya," Gandhi said on Tuesday at an event to launch the website, which is the first of its kind in India.

"Then if you see the child anywhere, you can upload information and then the police see if they can correlate it."

Around 70,000 children go missing every year in India, Gandhi said, citing figures from the National Crime Records Bureau. But only 73,597 children have been traced between January 2012 and April 2015, she added.

Child rights activists and government officials say that many of the country's missing children come from poor rural areas or urban slums where they are at high risk.

"Most of the missing children are trafficked for labor, for sexual exploitation, abducted, or kidnapped ... They could be runaways from home, or simply be lost," said a government statement.

"This is the reason that it is not only important to get the information related to these missing children, but it is equally important that the information is exchanged speedily to locate the children."

It said that social media could play "a pivotal role" in the search for missing children, as it would mean faster reporting.

Child rights activists welcomed the initiative and dismissed claims that it would only serve a small fraction of the country's population, around 25 percent of whom are Internet users.

"Even if people do not know how to use the Internet or have access, they can enlist the help of the village council members, an NGO, or local officials to register their case," said Ravi Kant, president of Shakti Vahini, an anti-trafficking charity.

"Many NGOs like ours have already being going out into communities where children are at high risk and informing people of Khoya Paya and how they can use it. It is a good step towards finding our missing children."

Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) said on Wednesday it has no plans to merge with affiliate Samsung SDS Co Ltd (018260.KS), in an attempt to quell speculation that such a deal is in the works to help Samsung Group's succession process.

"The management wants me to express clearly that we do not have a plan to merge with SDS," Robert Yi, Samsung Electronics' head of investor relations, said at a company event in Seoul.

Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] has been restructuring its sprawling business empire over the past year to secure a stable transfer of control from the founding family patriarch Lee Kun-hee to his three children. The elder Lee remains hospitalized following a May 2014 heart attack, adding urgency to these efforts.

Some investors and analysts have said Samsung Electronics and Samsung SDS, an IT services company, could merge soon. Such a deal would give Samsung Group heir apparent Jay Y. Lee and his sisters, major shareholders in SDS, shares in Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel of South Korea's top conglomerate.

"This announcement may not remove all the rumors and hearsayers in the market but I hope it conveys the management's thoughts on this issue," Yi said.

Samsung's de facto holding firm, Cheil Industries Inc (028260.KS), and Samsung C&T Corp (000830.KS) announced in late-May an all-stock merger, putting stakes in key manufacturing and financial arms in a single vehicle under the Lee heirs' control.

Investors expect more group consolidation moves to be announced in the near term, though Samsung Group has not disclosed its restructuring plans.

Banks will start collecting orders for the initial public offering of Telecom Italia tower unit Inwit next week, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.

Telecom Italia aims to sell up to 40 percent of Inwit in the IPO to raise money to upgrade its networks and return its domestic business to growth.

Inwit could be worth up to 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion) according to research notes from Mediobanca Securities and Banca IMI, which are global coordinators of the share sale.

Japanese telecoms group SoftBank Corp (9984.T) is investing $1 billion in South Korean online retailer Coupang as part of a plan to step up its overseas expansion and as it struggles to turn around U.S. carrier Sprint (S.N) which it bought in 2013.

SoftBank has been turning to overseas deals for growth amid a lackluster Japanese economy and shrinking demographics. The latest move comes two days after SoftBank said it had increased its controlling stake in Supercell, the Finnish mobile games maker best known for its hit title 'Clash of Clans'.

The funding, which is expected to close in July, brings the total sum Coupang has raised over the past year to $1.5 billion, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday. They did not disclose the size of SoftBank's stake in Coupang following the deal.

Coupang, founded in 2010 by Harvard dropout Bom Kim, offers daily deals on goods ranging from beauty products to tickets for travel and is South Korea's top online commerce firm by revenue.

E-commerce has grown rapidly in South Korea, where consumers routinely buy goods ranging from toilet paper to designer handbags through their computers or smartphones.

But intense competition and high promotion costs have raised questions about the industry's profitability. Coupang reported an operating loss of 122 billion won ($110.52 million) last year.

SoftBank's investment comes after Groupon Inc's (GRPN.O) announcement in April that it would sell a 46 percent stake in Ticket Monster, its South Korean e-commerce business, for $360 million to a partnership formed by KKR (KKR.N) and Anchor Equity Partners.

Global subscriptions for smartphones will more than double by 2020, helping mobile data traffic to ninefold, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker Ericsson predicted on Wednesday.

The Swedish company said it expected there will be 6.1 billion smartphone subscriptions globally by the end of 2020, up from 2.6 billion in 2014.

"Advanced mobile technology will be globally ubiquitous by 2020 with 70 percent of people using smartphones and 90 percent covered by mobile broadband networks," it said in its semi-annual Mobility Report.

Ericsson made no major changes compared to its previous forecast in November.

It said video is expected to increase its share of total mobile traffic in 2020 to 60 percent, up from an earlier projection of 55 percent and compared to around 45 percent in 2014.
