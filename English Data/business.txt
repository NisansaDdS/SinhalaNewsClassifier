Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, and operating results easily beat forecasts, boosted by its railroad and insurance businesses and gains from derivatives.

Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment conglomerate rose to $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, from $4.71 billion, or $2,862, a year earlier.

Quarterly operating profit increased 20 percent to $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share, from $3.53 billion, or $2,149. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,373 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 7 percent to $48.64 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 0.5 percent from year-end to $146,963.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, called results "really strong," in contrast to many companies in sectors where Berkshire competes that have posted "middling" performance.

Results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders are expected to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at Berkshire's helm.

Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of questions at the meeting, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 shareholders. It is part of a weekend of events throughout Omaha that Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists."

Once a struggling textile mill, Berkshire now has more than 80 operating companies in the energy, food, industrial products, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks.

RAILROAD REBOUNDS

Profit from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad totaled $1.05 billion, up 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called "substandard" service that left many customers unhappy.

Berkshire attributed the better performance this year to increased capacity, new equipment and other upgrades made as part of a $6 billion capital improvement program that will continue this year.

"It's good to see the railroad recovering. That's the most important driver here," said Jeff Matthews, who runs the Ram Partners hedge fund in Naples, Florida, owns Berkshire shares in his own account, and has written several books about Buffett.

Berkshire recorded $857 million of profit from derivatives, primarily from contracts that will benefit Berkshire if stock markets rise over the long-term. The stronger U.S. dollar added to these gains by reducing liabilities under contracts denominated in foreign currencies.

Accounting rules require Berkshire to report derivatives gains with quarterly results. Buffett downplays their importance, saying they do not reflect business performance.

Currency fluctuations also boosted results at a unit that insures against major catastrophes, contributing to a 15 percent overall profit jump in insurance to $1.36 billion.

Not all insurance businesses fared well. Underwriting profit at the auto insurer Geico fell 55 percent as it paid out more to cover claims, causing it to increase premium rates.

Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc in Toronto, said Geico is facing pressures from rivals that are slashing prices. "I would like to see it a bit stronger," said Hull, who owns Berkshire shares. "Overall the company is still doing okay."

Meanwhile, the General Re reinsurer lost money from underwriting, as it struggled with price competition, higher claims and currency losses in its international operations.

ENERGY RESULTS WEAKEN

Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, saw profit fall 7 percent to $421 million, reflecting lower revenues from natural gas operations.

Berkshire also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Brooks athletic shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.

The company ended the quarter with $63.71 billion of cash, enough to fund one or more giant acquisitions.

It will own a roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co after H.J. Heinz Co, now owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, buys Kraft Foods Group Inc, combining Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta and other brands under one roof.

Major stock holdings, meanwhile, include American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co.

In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $2,400 at $215,800, and its Class B shares rose $2.15 to $143.36.

The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set last Dec. 8. Berkshire's market value is roughly $355 billion, ranking fifth among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

U.S. stocks bounced back sharply on Friday as investors snapped up beaten-down shares in the healthcare and technology sectors, and as data gave further signs of a pickup in the economy.

Apple (AAPL.O) provided the biggest boost to the major indexes, jumping 3 percent to $128.95 in its biggest daily percentage gain since January. The stock lost 2.7 percent on Thursday.

The Nasdaq snapped a four-day losing streak while the S&P tech sector .SPLRCT gained 1.5 percent, among the day's best-performing sectors.

Biotech shares also rebounded, ending a five-day losing streak. The Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI was up 2.9 percent for the day, but lost 5.5 percent for the week, its worst such decline since March 2014.

Shares of Gilead (GILD.O) rose 4.5 percent to $105.01, helping to lift both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, after its quarterly profit nearly doubled. The S&P healthcare index .SPXHC was up 1.3 percent.

Investors were also buoyed by an encouraging batch of data for April that suggested the U.S. economy was pulling out of a first-quarter soft patch.

"Yesterday people were thinking the market was going to fall off of a cliff, and today we're seeing a lot of institutional buying coming in," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.

"So, the buy-the-dippers show up and defend the market. That leads me to believe there's more upside."

Indexes posted losses for the week, however, with social media shares among the weakest performers following disappointing outlooks and results this week from several key players including Twitter (TWTR.N).

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 183.54 points, or 1.03 percent, to 18,024.06, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 22.78 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,108.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 63.97 points, or 1.29 percent, to 5,005.39.

LinkedIn (LNKD.N), Twitter and Yelp (YELP.N) all notched their biggest weekly percentage declines since their debuts. LinkedIn, which reported results late Thursday, dropped 18.6 percent to $205.21.

For the week, the Dow was down 0.3 percent, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 percent.

Consumer sentiment jumped and vehicle sales for GM (GM.N) and Ford (F.N) were stronger-than-expected in April, while manufacturing expansion in the month held steady at near a two-year low.

Railcar makers gained after tougher oil-train safety standards, including rules to phase out older tank cars in three years, were announced.

Greenbrier (GBX.N) gained 8 percent to $62.33, while Trinity Industries (TRN.N) rose 6.9 percent to $28.96. American Railcar (ARII.O) was up 5.9 percent at $56.18.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,850 to 1,201, for a 1.54-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,664 issues rose and 1,118 fell for a 1.49-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 69 new lows.

About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.2 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported a 43 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday, though results beat analysts' expectations as cost cuts and robust refining margins helped offset the impact of tumbling crude prices.

The help from refining operations mirrored results at large, integrated peers such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which tend to lean on their refining divisions for profit during times of cheap oil.

Oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have slumped more than 40 percent since last June amid a glut of global supply, harming Chevron's division that produces oil and gas, its largest, but helping profit more than double to $1.42 billion at its refining arm.

A Reuters analysis of industry data, though, shows that this "refining boom" for the sector isn't likely to last long, and that producers' best chance for improving profit is higher oil prices.

"The good thing about the quarter is that it's over," said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. "Going forward, costs will continue to go down and oil prices are slowly going up, so margins will improve."

Chevron has sold $4 billion in assets so far this year, part of a broader divestment plan to help fund its dividend from cash flow.

"We will continue to sell assets when we can generate good value," Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said on a conference call with investors. "Maintaining a competitive and growing dividend is our No. 1 priority."

Shares of the San Ramon, California-based company fell 2.3 percent to $108.48 in afternoon trading.

EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS

The No. 2 U.S. oil company reported net income of $2.57 billion, or $1.37 per share, down from $4.51 billion, or $2.36 a share, a year earlier, but much better than analysts' expectations of 79 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Chevron posted a loss in its United States oil production division, a key indicator that the country is one of its highest cost areas.

Production grew 4 percent to 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, boosted largely by operations in the United States, Bangladesh and Argentina.

Chevron continued slashing costs during the first quarter, reducing operating expenses by 9 percent.

The company is renegotiating contracts with nearly 3,000 vendors and expects to wring about $900 million in cost savings out of them this year, Yarrington said.

The Federal Reserve could well raise interest rates as soon as June, two top U.S. central bankers said on Friday, so long as economic data strengthens as expected from a dismal first quarter.

That view - from the hawkish-leaning chief of the Cleveland Fed and from the centrist head of the San Francisco Fed - is at odds with the view of many traders, whose bets in the interest-rate futures markets suggest they have all but discounted a June rate hike and now expect the Fed to wait until December before raising rates for the first time since 2006.

The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008.

The key, both Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said, is that by a quirk of the calendar there will be two more months of data for many of the key gauges the Fed follows, including the U.S. jobless rate, jobs gains, retail sales and others.

All scheduled Fed policy meetings, including the next one, in June, are "on the table," Mester told reporters in Philadelphia. "There are a whole bunch of data releases that will come out between now and June. But to me the employment reports will be indicative of a lot."

The U.S. economy's weak winter performance, including near-zero growth in gross domestic product, has pushed back market expectations for a policy tightening to September or December, when key Fed meetings are also scheduled.

Yet the Fed has telegraphed a rate hike this year, and unemployment, at 5.5 percent, is not too far from what many economists believe represents full employment.

"I agree with the way my colleague Loretta Mester put it," Williams told reporters after a speech at Chapman University, repeating Mester's phrase that all meetings are "on the table."

"Really positive data trends, improvement in the labor market, signs that improve the confidence and the expectation that inflation will move back to 2 percent - I mean could imagine that constellation of data coming in, whether before June or meetings right after that too," Williams said. "But that would require the data to be good."

Both Mester and Williams pointed to recent data showing inflation may be firming, suggested they are gaining confidence it is heading toward the Fed's 2 percent target.

Looking beyond the Fed's first rate hike, Williams said the U.S. central bank should put some "space" between the start of policy normalization and the decision to allow the Fed's giant balance sheet to shrink.

Requiring the Federal Reserve to operate according to a monetary policy rule could generate worse economic outcomes than using a goal-based mandate like an inflation target, a top Federal Reserve official said on Friday.

"Particularly in situations of economic stress or crisis, operational mandates have proven to be ineffective and have often been abandoned," San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in remarks prepared for delivery at Chapman University.

That view is widely held among Fed policymakers, who believe that forcing the U.S. central bank to inflexibly follow a fixed monetary policy rule would inhibit its ability to right the economy during a crisis. Such a requirement is the centerpiece of legislation recently proposed in the U.S. Congress as part of an effort to beef up oversight of the central bank.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last year said the proposal would be a "grave mistake."

What stood out about Williams' remarks Friday was his comparatively restrained tone.

A policy-rule-based approach is "unquestionably superior" to past efforts to stipulate the central bank's approach to policy, including the failed gold standard and the fixed-exchange-rate mandate, he said.

Still, Williams said, before "rushing into" such an approach, legislators should consider circumstances in which it might fail, including times when the economy shrinks so dramatically that negative interest rates would be required. The unconventional monetary policy the Fed followed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, he noted, would have fallen outside a rules-based approach.

"Mechanically following one type of standard policy rule designed to work well under one set of assumptions can yield very poor economic outcomes when those assumptions are violated," Williams said.

There are also questions, he said, about how to define certain aspects of a policy rule, including the definition of full employment, which changes through time.
"A potentially more promising approach to address the independence dilemma may be to look to the experiences of inflation-targeting countries, where the principle of enhancing accountability and transparency within a goal mandate framework has proven to be very successful."

Williams said one approach is to follow the lead of some other major central banks, whose heads must make public explanations when inflation targets are missed.

The Fed's 2 percent inflation target, which it has missed for many years running, is set internally and is not subject to such formal public accounting.

BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) was sentenced to five years probation by a U.S. judge on Friday in connection with a record $8.9 billion settlement resolving claims that it violated sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.

U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan formally ordered the French bank to forfeit $8.83 billion and pay a $140 million fine as part of a sentence that also called for BNP Paribas to enhance its compliance procedures and policies.

Some of that money could now go to people harmed by the three sanctioned countries under a program the U.S. Justice Department announced in court.

Georges Dirani, BNP's general counsel, told the judge that the bank accepted "full responsibility for its conduct," and was under CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafé's personal supervision already improving its policies.

"There's no question the organization will not tolerate the kind of behavior we have seen in this case," Dirani said.

The case marked the first time a global bank pleaded guilty to violations of U.S. economic sanctions, the Justice Department said.

The sentencing followed BNP Paribas' guilty plea in July to conspiring from 2004 to 2012 to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act.

The sentence imposed by Schofield followed the terms of a heavily negotiated plea deal the Justice Department announced that month.

Authorities said that BNP essentially functioned as the "central bank for the government of Sudan," concealing its tracks and failing to cooperate when first contacted by law enforcement.

Prosecutors said BNP also evaded sanctions against entities in Iran and Cuba, in part by stripping information from wire transfers so they could pass through the U.S. system without raising red flags.

BOMBING VICTIMS

Friday's sentencing took place in a courtroom crowded with people Schofield said claimed to have been harmed by actions taken by the sanctioned countries and who were seeking restitution.

While Schofield said they were not legally entitled to that relief, prosecutor Jennifer Ambuehl said the Justice Department would evaluate distributing the $3.84 billion in forfeitures it received in the deal to people harmed by Sudan, Cuba and Iran.

Ambuehl called the effort "unprecedented" and said the Justice Department would shortly be launching a website to accept claims.

But the program, which covers anyone harmed from 2004 to 2012, came as a disappointment to victims of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people.

Several victims had flown to New York in anticipation of the program's announcement. They had cited a U.S. court's finding that without Sudan's support, al Qaeda could not have perpetrated the attacks.

"We had hoped that the Department of Justice would stand with us and are deeply disappointed that it chose to delay and not do the right thing," George Mimba, the former head of the Kenya embassy employees, said in a statement.

BNP's sentencing had been delayed for months while it awaited word on whether the U.S. Labor Department would allow it to continue to manage retirement plans despite the plea. The department granted BNP that exemption this month.

A New York state court judge on April 15 sentenced BNP Paribas in a related case in which it agreed to forfeit $2.24 billion.

That sum, along with a $508 million payment to the Federal Reserve and a $2.24 billion payment to the New York Department of Financial Services, are credited toward the $8.9 billion ordered by Schofield on Friday.

The sentencing came a day after BNP Paribas reported first-quarter net income of 1.65 billion euros ($1.83 billion), up 17.5 percent. Revenue grew 11.6 percent to 11.1 billion euros.

The case is U.S. v. BNP Paribas SA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cr-00460.

U.S. auto industry sales in April came in below expectations as Asia's major carmakers' results disappointed, offsetting strong gains for trucks and SUVs made by General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N).

Sales reported on Friday by Japan's Nissan (7201.T), Toyota (7203.T) and Honda (7267.T), as well as the combined results for South Korea's Hyundai (005380.KS) and its Kia (000270.KS) affiliate, all missed expectations. Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) also disappointed.

Industry sales in April finished at 1,454,951 vehicles, up 4.6 percent according to research firm Autodata. That was below the gain of 6 percent analysts had expected as consumer appetite for trucks and SUVs favored the "Big Three" Detroit automakers.

"When demand for crossovers, SUVs and trucks is strong, the Asian automakers don't do so well," said Jesse Toprak, an independent consultant.

The industry's annual sales rate for the month was 16.50 million vehicles, below the 16.7 million to 16.8 million many analysts had expected.

Nevertheless, industry executives said demand remains strong and the industry was headed toward its best year in almost a decade.

"Consumer and commercial customer demand for pickups and utility vehicles has been building since last fall," said Kurt McNeil, GM's U.S. vice president of sales operations. "The auto industry continues to be on track to have its best sales year since 2006."

U.S. industry sales slipped to 16.5 million vehicles in 2006 from almost 17 million the prior year, and fell as low as 10.4 million in 2009 during the recession, before beginning to climb.

VEHICLE PRICES RISING

Ford officials said average vehicle prices in the industry were up $1,000 from last year to $31,200 per vehicle, and dismissed concerns about longer loan rates, with some now at 84 months.

Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the increase in duration has been driven by buyers with good credit scores stretching to buy more premium vehicles, rather than by consumers with high-risk credit.

The other side of hot truck demand is weaker car sales, which has led to production cuts and layoffs by some automakers. Ford previously said it would lay off 700 people and reduce production at the Michigan plant building the Focus, which saw sales in April fall 5 percent. LaNeve vowed Ford would not create "unnatural demand" for cars through higher incentives.

GM's April sales rose 6 percent to 269,056 vehicles as truck and crossover sales jumped 13 percent and 25 percent, respectively.

Ford's sales increased 5.4 percent to 222,498 vehicles as sales of Ford-brand SUVs jumped 12 percent. Retail sales of the new F-Series pickup truck increased 8 percent, and its average sales prices hit an all-time high of $42,600 per vehicle.

Fiat Chrysler's sales rose 5.8 percent to 189,027 vehicles as Jeep brand sales jumped 20 percent.

Nissan sales increased 5.7 percent to 109,848 vehicles as demand for Nissan crossovers, trucks and SUVs rose 23.7 percent. Toyota was up 1.8 percent, while Honda sales fell by the same amount. Hyundai sales rose 2.9 percent, while Kia's slipped almost 1 percent.

U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months and demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy was struggling to find momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter.

Other data on Friday showed construction spending hit a six-month low in March, also indicating that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint. That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year.

The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production.

"The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013.

The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.

While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009.

Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar's 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June.

The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world's largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to cut their profit forecasts for the full year.

Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N), the world's largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015.

Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling.

Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year.

U.S. stocks closed higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.

REGAINING FOOTING

Separately, auto sales fell to an annualized pace of 16.45 million vehicles last month from a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. However, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks, and crossover and sports utility vehicles.

Demand for autos is likely to pick up in the months ahead. In another report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March.

Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales.

"This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September.

Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak.

"We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) on Thursday unveiled Tesla Energy - storage systems or batteries for homes, companies and utilities that will expand its business beyond electric vehicles and tap into a fast-growing area of the energy industry.

Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company's goal was to "fundamentally change the way the world uses energy on an extreme scale." He introduced the products to a crowd of business partners and journalists at a Tesla facility near Los Angeles.

In Tesla's view, such storage systems could become part of a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries.

The smallest battery unveiled on Thursday, known as Powerwall, is housed in a six-inch-wide container that is meant to be hung inside a garage or on the outside wall of a house.
At $3,500 for a 10kWh model, excluding inverter and installation prices, the Powerwall can be used for backup power or to store solar energy.

Tesla's lead installation partner for the home battery will be SolarCity Corp (SCTY.O), the solar installer backed by Musk. The company will also partner with many others, Musk said.

Tesla has several hundred batteries installed with SolarCity systems in California already. The growth of those projects has been helped by a subsidy from California's public utility regulator.

Utilities have also been seeking out energy storage to help manage increasing amounts of renewable energy on the grid. To address that market, Musk unveiled what he called the "power pack," a 100 kWh battery block that is meant to help smooth out power from intermittent solar and wind energy production or add energy to the grid quickly when demand levels are high.

Tesla already has several utility-scale batteries deployed on the grid in California, which requires its biggest utilities to source large amounts of energy storage.

Musk told reporters Tesla expected to have a low but growing gross margin in battery products in the fourth quarter of this year and added that battery products would be "materially profitable" some time next year.

"A cost effective home energy storage system it could prove far more valuable, and profitable, than anything the company is doing with automobiles," Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said.

Tesla will initially manufacture the batteries at its automobile factory in California but will move production to its planned "gigafactory" in Nevada next year.

Deutsche Bank estimated sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at the large factory the company is building in Nevada.

Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA.

Tesla is not the only player in energy storage. Coda Energy, which rose from the ashes of a failed EV maker and is now owned by Fortress Investment and startups backed by the likes of Total (TOTF.PA), GE (GE.N) and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) are among the many companies going after shares of the stationary storage market.

Options traders appear poised for a big move in McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) shares as the world's biggest restaurant chain is set to unveil a much-awaited turnaround plan on Monday, and bullish bets have picked up in recent days.

McDonald's shares have struggled in the last year as the company faces consumers' changing tastes and growing preference for healthier fare over processed fast food.

Smaller, nimbler competitors such as Wendy's Co (WEN.O) and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) have been more responsive to those changing tastes.

After dismal first-quarter results in April, McDonald's new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said he would soon share details on plans to reinvigorate the company. Bullish options have been bid up in anticipation of the plan.

"In stark contrast to the typical post-earnings selloff in implied volatility, McDonald's options have seen a consistently high bid since the announcement of the turnaround plan," said Anshul Agarwal, equity derivative strategist at Bay Crest Partners.

Implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in a stock, typically rides up ahead of earnings reports and then collapses once the event is over.

For McDonald's the 30-day implied volatility is at 26.57 percent, or about the highest it has been over the last two years, according to Livevol data.

On Friday, the cost of a May weekly straddle in McDonald's options, a strategy in which a trader buys an at-the-money put option and a similar call option, implies a move of about 4.5 percent in either direction by May 8.

This would make for one of the biggest five-day moves for the shares over the last two years.

Since April 22, open interest in calls, which are usually used for betting on the shares rising, has increased by a third to more than half a million contracts, compared with a 13 percent rise in puts.

For every put contract there are two calls open, the highest this ratio has been favoring calls over the last 52 weeks.

Bets on the shares rising above $100 by mid-May and June, have been especially busy, suggesting that investors have high expectations from the company on Monday, Agarwal said.

McDonald's shares, which have risen about 3 percent over the last six, were up 1 percent at $97.75 on Friday on the New York Stock exchange.

A New York jury on Friday convicted a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) programmer of stealing some of the bank's high-frequency trading code, in a legal battle closely watched by Wall Street and the financial world.

The jury found Sergey Aleynikov guilty on only one count of stealing "secret scientific material" from Goldman. They were unable to reach a verdict on another similar count and acquitted him on a count of unlawful duplication.

Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, said after the verdict that the defense would file a motion for dismissal of the conviction, which he said was fatally flawed.

Aleynikov, 45, a dual U.S. and Russian citizen, helped inspire Michael Lewis’ bestselling book “Flash Boys" about the rise and corrosive effects of high-speed trading in the U.S. equity market.

Aleynikov had been previously tried and convicted in federal court over the computer code theft and served nearly a year in prison before an appeals court overturned his conviction in 2012. The verdict delivered on Friday, after eight days of deliberation, amounted to a violation of the "double jeopardy" statute in U.S. law, Marino told reporters.

Aleynikov could face 1-1/2 years to four years in prison for the felony for which he was convicted, according to prosecutors, although there is no mandatory minimum. State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Conviser, who said he would issue his final decision in the case in five to six weeks, suggested he is likely to be lenient.

Conviser did not set a sentencing date and noted that Aleynikov had already served nearly a year in prison for his crime.

"His goal is to be exonerated," Conviser said. He gave the defense until May 15 to submit its motion for dismissal.

Marino argued during the trial that Aleynikov broke no law in copying code from Goldman's high-frequency trading software for his own use, even if he violated the bank's internal policy.

DELIBERATIONS MARRED

Prosecutors had charged Aleynikov with stealing the computer code in 2009, as he prepared to leave Goldman for a high-frequency trading startup in Chicago.

About six months after he was freed from prison, when his earlier conviction was thrown out on appeal, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance charged Aleynikov in August 2012 with unlawful duplication of computer-related material.

That was the charge that the jury acquitted him of on Friday.

Speaking after the verdict to reporters, Marino said "the jury was confused" by some of the legal issues behind Aleynikov's trial, adding that case against his client highlighted the influence of Goldman Sachs in a lower Manhattan court just a stone's throw away from Wall Street.

"Goldman Sachs is a tremendously powerful organization, scarily powerful," Marino said. "Mr. Aleynikov will continue to fight this battle until it is won."

Vance said Friday's outcome marked an important victory for the government and the New York financial center in "an increasingly competitive digital and global market."

The conviction came two days after the judge overseeing the case removed two jurors after a conflict between the two marred deliberations.

It remains unclear what prompted the bizarre dispute on Tuesday between the two discharged jurors.

A female juror had accused her male colleague of trying to poison her food, and on Tuesday Marino mentioned that the conflict may have involved an avocado sandwich.

The case is People v. Aleynikov, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 04447/2012.

Another day, another shock for investors in social media stocks.

Shares of LinkedIn Corp, operator of the most popular social network for professionals, fell 20 percent in early trading on Friday, wiping out more than $6 billion of market value, after the company slashed its full-year forecast.

LinkedIn reported on Thursday its slowest quarterly revenue growth since it went public four years ago.

The surprisingly weak results followed Twitter Inc's on Tuesday. Twitter's stock fell by as much as 24 percent, slicing about $6 billion off its market value.

Even Facebook Inc posted its slowest growth in quarterly revenue in two years last Wednesday, and its shares have fallen about five percent since.

Facebook's earnings were better than expected, though, and the comparatively small drop in its stock price indicated a level of investor confidence not shown to Twitter and LinkedIn.

LinkedIn cited slower revenue growth in its hiring business and a delay in recognizing revenue from lynda.com - the online education company it agreed to buy last month - for its weaker results and cut in profit and revenue forecast.

LinkedIn's shares fell to about $200 in early trading, far below their record high of $276.17 reached in late February.

At least 23 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, by as much as $65 to as low as $172.

Still, in contrast to Twitter, most analysts were upbeat about LinkedIn's prospects.

"The market is putting LinkedIn in the Twitter bucket," analysts at Stifel Nicolaus wrote. "We think the market is wrong. LinkedIn is not Twitter.

"Yes, this is a reset but we believe LinkedIn is a sustainable and dominant franchise that is becoming woven into the fabric of our daily professional lives."

Stifel, which has a "buy" on LinkedIn, cut its price target to $250 from $300.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney also said the market had overreacted. "While we are incrementally less positive, we're not 20 percent less positive," Mahaney said.

RBC kept its "outperform" rating, but cut its price target to $275 from $300.

Pacific Crest analysts kept their "overweight" rating while cutting their price target to $250 from $295.

"We like LinkedIn on its strong fundamentals, the shift

from traditional offline recruiting to online, and its superior products versus its competition," they said in a note.

Of 41 analysts covering the stock, 31 rate it "buy" or higher while nine have a "hold", according to Thomson Reuters data.

Only one brokerage, Brean Capital, rates the stock "sell".

"Weaker results were blamed on a large sales force re-org and FX, but we think the company is scrambling to buy growth and the re-org is due to product fatigue," Brean analysts wrote.

U.S. consumer sentiment in April rose versus the prior month to its highest level since January, but was slightly below analyst expectations for a final reading, a survey released on Friday showed.

The University of Michigan's final April reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 95.9, unchanged from the preliminary April reading. The final reading in March was 93.0. Analysts were looking for a final April reading of 96.0 according to a poll by Reuters.

The survey's final reading of the subindex on current conditions rose to 107 from 105.0 in March, while a read on final consumer expectations rose to 88.8 from 85.3. The median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for a reading of 108.3 for the conditions index and 88.1 for expectations.

The Federal Reserve is getting close to the appropriate time to raise interest rates and all scheduled policy meetings, including one in June, are "on the table" for a move, a top Fed official said on Friday.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who in the past has urged a rate hike before mid-year, told reporters that the decision will hinge on incoming economic data and, in particular, on employment reports for the months of April and May.

The U.S. economy's weak winter performance, including near-zero GDP growth, has pushed back market expectations for a policy tightening to September or December, when key Fed meetings are also planned.

Yet the Fed has telegraphed a rate hike this year, and inflation and employment are not too far from targets. Mester said most of the weakness was "transitory."

"All meetings are on the table ... I'm going into each meeting with an assessment of the data that has come in," she said after a speech on consumer credit at the Philadelphia Fed, where in the past she ran the research department.

"There are a whole bunch of data releases that will come out between now and June. But to me the employment reports will be indicative of a lot," Mester said.

Inflation data released Thursday, including a report showing solid wage gains in the first quarter, "show things are coming back a little bit," added Mester, who does not vote on policy until next year under a rotation.

She was the first Fed official to speak publicly about policy after the Federal Open Market Committee closed a meeting Wednesday with a statement highlighting the first-quarter weakness but also paving the way to a rate hike at any point.

Asked about the statement, Mester said it did not reflect decreasing confidence that inflation will rebound to a 2 percent target. "We're getting close to the point where it will be time to lift off," she said of the coming hike.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) said it was expanding a recall to include 156,000 more vehicles to fix a potential door latch malfunction.

The recalls include certain Ford Fiesta, Fusion and Lincoln MKZ models. (ford.to/1dAAxIv)

The company recalled about 390,000 of the three vehicle models in North America last week to fix the same issue.

The driver's door can potentially unlatch while the car is in motion, increasing the risk of injury, Ford said.

Ford has said it is aware of two incidents in which an unlatched door bounced back and struck the driver and one incident in which an unlatched door swung open and struck another vehicle.

U.S. construction spending fell in March to a six-month low as outlays on private residential construction spending declined sharply, which could add to concerns about the economy's ability to rebound strongly from the first-quarter's soft patch.

Construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion, the lowest level since September, the Commerce Department said on Friday.

February's outlays were revised to show them unchanged instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip. Economists polled by Reuters had expected construction spending to rise 0.5 percent in March.

While there are signs the economy is regaining some speed after almost stalling in the first quarter, data on construction and manufacturing suggest a lack of strong momentum in activity.

The economy was slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar, a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have cut domestic energy production.

In March, construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest decline since June. Outlays for single-family construction fell 1.8 percent and multi-family home building tumbled 2.1 percent.

Spending on private non-residential construction projects rose 1.0 percent in March.

Public construction outlays were weak, with spending on federal government projects tumbling 4.9 percent. State and local government outlays - the largest portion of the public sector segment - fell 1.2 percent to a one-year low.

The pace of U.S. manufacturing growth held at its slowest in almost two years in April, as a rebound in new orders was offset by employment shrinking to its lowest level in more than five years, according to an industry report released on Friday.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity was 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013. The reading fell shy of expectations of 52.0, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. This was the 29th-consecutive headline reading at or above 50.

The employment index fell into contractionary territory for the first time since May 2013, dropping to 48.3, the lowest reading since September 2009. In March, the employment sub-index came in at 50.0.

On the upside, the new orders index rose to 53.5 from 51.8 in March, while the prices paid index rose to 40.5 from 39, returning above 40 after four straight months below that level.

Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) works council has backed the carmaker's choice of two new supervisory board members, appointments reportedly opposed by newly departed Chairman Ferdinand Piech.

The labor officials, who control half the 20 seats on the supervisory board, forced Piech? out a week ago with the backing of Lower Saxony, VW's No. 2 shareholder. They cited a breach of trust following a two-week public showdown Piech had provoked with Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn.

Ahead of a shareholder meeting on May 5, Europe's largest carmaker installed two of Piech's nieces as board members on Thursday, filling vacancies left by Piech and his wife, who also quit the 20-seat panel.

But Piech - a dominant figure at VW for more than two decades - is challenging the appointments of Louise Kiesling and Julia Kuhn-Piech, daily newspaper Bild reported on Thursday. 

Instead, he nominated long-time automotive manager Wolfgang Reitzle - seen as a potential replacement chairman - and former Siemens (SIEGn.DE) manager Brigitte Ederer, Bild said.

However labor representatives have backed the company's choice of directors.

"We welcome this step to complete the supervisory board and are looking forward to co-operating with Mrs Kiesling and Mrs Kuhn-Piech," a spokesman for the works council said on Friday.

In Germany any shareholder, the works council and the company itself are entitled to nominate a new member to fill a vacancy on the supervisory board between annual shareholder meetings via a court, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters, citing the law on stock companies.

For Piech, the only way to thwart the VW appointments would be to bring legal action against the court ruling, the source said.

German industrial firm Siemens (SIEGn.DE) plans to keep most of its 13 underperforming businesses for now and will try to sell a handful of "marginal" operations, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Siemens said late last year it would decide by May what to do with the businesses it has identified as problems and that account for 18 percent of sales, or some 13 billion euros ($15 billion), and no profit.

The source said Siemens would try to sell three to five small divisions, such as industrial waste water treatment, which require expertise that does not fit with Siemens' electrical competence, or operations that will cost too much to fix.

"These are marginal things," the person said. "The core businesses will be restructured."

Siemens, which has not disclosed what the 13 businesses are, declined to comment.

Once a sprawling engineering group with businesses from trains to turbines to hospital IT to hearing aids, Siemens is being streamlined by new Chief Executive Joe Kaeser.

He wants to focus on Siemens' strengths in electrification, automation and digitalization and close a profitability gap with arch-rival General Electric (GE.N).

A second source familiar with the matter said Kaeser wanted to prove Siemens could turn around unprofitable businesses by itself.

The decision is due to be taken at Siemens' supervisory board meeting next Wednesday before it presents second-quarter results on Thursday, the first source said.

Siemens is aiming for an industrial profit margin of 10-11 percent in its current financial year under a new way of defining its profits. The margin was 10.2 percent in its first quarter to the end of December.

The company has said a 10-11 percent margin will be a clear improvement on its previous financial year but has not given a comparable figure.

That compares with an industrial margin of 16.2 percent at GE last year and Swiss engineering group ABB's (ABBN.VX) 13.5 percent operating margin.

Siemens is also restructuring its power and gas unit, where profits have collapsed due to price pressures in gas and steam turbines. They are becoming unprofitable for operators in many markets due to a rise in renewable energy and lower demand.

It is cutting at least 1,200 jobs in this area and trade union IG Metall fears there will be thousands of job cuts in Germany over the coming years. Siemens employs 343,000 staff worldwide, a third of whom are in Germany.

Oil prices eased off 2015 highs on Friday after Iraq said its crude oil exports hit a record in April, and on pressure from a stronger dollar.

Both Brent and U.S. crude settled well above intraday lows, supported by data showing another slip in drilling rig activity and news of a shut gasoline-making unit in Venezuela.

Venezuela's 645,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Amuay refinery has halted its catalytic cracking unit for maintenance, helping U.S. RBOB gasoline RBc1 and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) HOc1 futures post higher settlements on the first day of trading with June contracts in front-month position.

June Brent LCOc1 crude fell 32 cents to settle at $66.46 a barrel, after falling to $65.52 and having earlier matched Thursday's 2015 peak of $66.93. Brent jumped 21 percent in April.

U.S. June crude CLc1 fell 48 cents to settle at $59.15, after hitting a 2015 high of $59.90 and recovering from a $58.32 intraday low. U.S. crude futures gained 25 percent last month.

Trading volume was thinned as some major markets were closed for the May Day holiday.

Friday's pullback was initially sparked by news that Iraq's oil exports rose in April to a record 3.08 million bpd from 2.98 million bpd in March, which served as a reminder of ample supply in the market.

OPEC supply in April rose to its highest in more than two years at 31.04 million bpd, according to a Reuters survey.

"What is driving prices these days is less physical markets, which remain very weak, but more expectations of future tightening," said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects.

Despite a sharp drop in U.S. shale drilling in recent months, there have been few signs that a global supply glut is easing.

Oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) said on Friday that U.S. drilling activity fell by 24 rigs, fewer than the 31 rigs idled last week.

"If markets don't tighten as quickly as people are expecting, the sell-off can be large," Sen said.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY posted its best daily gain in a month, up from a two-month low on signs that the U.S. economy may be stabilizing after a soft patch.

The stronger dollar helped pressure several dollar-denominated commodities, including oil. .TRJCRB

Speculators cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to April 28, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

The U.S. stock market has struggled for direction of late, but next week's payroll report could confirm whether the recent weakness in data and stock prices is waning as the weather warms, or the start of a longer-term trend.

Over the past two weeks, the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX has moved an average of 17.79 points daily, wider than the 12.43 point range in early March. The swings have amplified on mixed economic signals.

While first-quarter earnings have topped expectations, revenue has fallen, with the biggest drops in the energy sector. U.S. data, including on economic growth, have been weak, but are seen as making the Federal Reserve less likely to raise interest rates soon, a view that has lifted market sentiment.

"There are a lot of offsetting trends in the market, which is causing a lot of choppy volatility," said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston.

"I don't see anything on the horizon that will get people to buy stocks in droves, including the payroll report."

The S&P 500 is about 1 percent away from the record close hit last Friday, when the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC also hit a record - its first since 2000. At these lofty levels, markets are vulnerable to a sell-off.

In a rare week in which both stocks and bonds weakened, traders may reconsider whether global yields will fall much further, given that the two-year German yield has been running below zero since last August. As yields rose in Europe this week, U.S. benchmark rates followed suit.

Investors have been willing to leave the safe haven of bonds for bigger returns in stocks. But this week's bond market selloff has boosted yields, part of the reason some of the week's biggest losers include utilities and consumer staples companies that pay higher dividends.

Some movement in Greece debt talks and less worrisome regional inflation data this week caused traders to reduce bets the European Central Bank might need to inject more stimulus. This led to the dumping of German Bunds, U.S. Treasuries and British Gilts.

"It appears there's finally a revaluation going on," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. "Equities are expensive relative to their history; the only market that makes them appear cheap is bonds."

Relative to junk bonds, the earnings yield on the S&P 500 - the inverse of the P/E ratio, which is used for valuation comparisons with bonds - is around 5.8 percent, data showed.

That is below the yield to maturity on junk bonds, of around 6.45 percent, indicating that stocks have a worse value than the riskiest corporate bonds.

About 213,000 jobs are seen having been added in April, after an add of 126,000 in March. That was the weakest reading since December 2013, hurt by both weak crude oil prices and a strong U.S. dollar.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Saturday that it was ready to work with the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) so long as standards were met, while also announcing changes to boost its own lending capacity by billions of dollars.

China has said 57 countries have signed up to become founding members of the AIIB, but so far the United States has chosen to remain outside the bank, seen as a rival to the U.S.-dominated World Bank.

Giving reasons for not joining, the United States has cited what it called a lack of transparency, doubts about lending and environmental safeguards, and concerns over Beijing's influence.

Japan, which has a lead role in the ADB, has also cited a lack of transparency at the Beijing-based AIIB for not joining by a March 31 deadline, but has said that it would be desirable for the ADB to work with the AIIB.

Addressing a media conference at the start of the multilateral lender's annual meeting of its board of governors in Azerbaijan, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said the bank wanted to cooperate with AIIB, provided criteria were met.

"ADB is happy to cooperate, including co-financing, with the AIIB," Nakao said in Baku. "With the AIIB, if we co-finance, we will study how we do things, but I don't have any intention to lower our standards."

The four-day meeting comes amid much discussion of the future of global development architecture as more countries, including most shareholders of the ADB, commit to becoming founding members of the AIIB.

On Friday, Nakao held an hour-long meeting with Liqun Jin, the secretary general of the AIIB's interim secretariat. The pair agreed to work together in Asia, including jointly financing infrastructure projects and sharing information.

"We shared the importance of safeguard policies about the environmental and social protection," Nakao said.

To boost its own lending capacity, the ADB also announced a merger of its Asian Development Fund and its ordinary capital resources balance sheet.

"The merger will boost ADB's total lending and grant approvals to as high as $20 billion - 50 percent more than the current level," it said in a statement.

The statement said that under the new initiative, ADB assistance to poor countries stood to rise by up to 70 percent, estimating that it could reach as high as $40 billion in coming years from $23 billion last year.

Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF railroad is "forever better" after a capital program last year boosted capacity following complaints about congestion, BNSF chief executive told Reuters on Saturday.

"The railroad's in better shape than it was. We think we've got opportunities going forward," said Carl Ice, BNSF's president and chief executive officer, speaking on the sidelines at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting.

The railroad saw its results improve in the first quarter, according to an earnings report released on Friday.

Profits at the railroad rose 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called "substandard" service that left many customers unhappy.

The railroad's $6 billion capital improvement program will continue this year.

"We were strong in grains for the first part of the year," Ice said, although he noted that coal could be slowing a bit.

The recent slump in oil prices constrained growth as well, Ice said. The railroad also had to deal with work stoppages on the West Coast after a contract dispute earlier this year led to months of disruptions at 29 West Coast ports.

Berkshire Hathaway is celebrating its 50th year with iconic billionaire Warren Buffett at the helm, and the annual meeting is expected to attract around 40,000 people from around the world.

Buffett has often highlighted BNSF as a major part of Berkshire Hathaway's future.

In last year's letter to shareholders, for example, he said the railroad will still be playing a major role in the U.S. economy a century from now.

"We've got another strong capital program this year," Ice said. "And those investments last forever. The railroad will be forever better with the things we've put in the last couple of years."

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, and operating results easily beat forecasts, boosted by its railroad and insurance businesses and gains from derivatives.

Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment conglomerate rose to $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, from $4.71 billion, or $2,862, a year earlier.

Quarterly operating profit increased 20 percent to $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share, from $3.53 billion, or $2,149. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,373 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 7 percent to $48.64 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 0.5 percent from year-end to $146,963.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, called results "really strong," in contrast to many companies in sectors where Berkshire competes that have posted "middling" performance.

Results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders are expected to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at Berkshire's helm.

Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of questions at the meeting, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 shareholders. It is part of a weekend of events throughout Omaha that Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists."

Once a struggling textile mill, Berkshire now has more than 80 operating companies in the energy, food, industrial products, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks.

RAILROAD REBOUNDS

Profit from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad totaled $1.05 billion, up 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called "substandard" service that left many customers unhappy.

Berkshire attributed the better performance this year to increased capacity, new equipment and other upgrades made as part of a $6 billion capital improvement program that will continue this year.

"It's good to see the railroad recovering. That's the most important driver here," said Jeff Matthews, who runs the Ram Partners hedge fund in Naples, Florida, owns Berkshire shares in his own account, and has written several books about Buffett.

Berkshire recorded $857 million of profit from derivatives, primarily from contracts that will benefit Berkshire if stock markets rise over the long-term. The stronger U.S. dollar added to these gains by reducing liabilities under contracts denominated in foreign currencies.

Accounting rules require Berkshire to report derivatives gains with quarterly results. Buffett downplays their importance, saying they do not reflect business performance.

Currency fluctuations also boosted results at a unit that insures against major catastrophes, contributing to a 15 percent overall profit jump in insurance to $1.36 billion.

Not all insurance businesses fared well. Underwriting profit at the auto insurer Geico fell 55 percent as it paid out more to cover claims, causing it to increase premium rates.

Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc in Toronto, said Geico is facing pressures from rivals that are slashing prices. "I would like to see it a bit stronger," said Hull, who owns Berkshire shares. "Overall the company is still doing okay."

Meanwhile, the General Re reinsurer lost money from underwriting, as it struggled with price competition, higher claims and currency losses in its international operations.

ENERGY RESULTS WEAKEN

Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, saw profit fall 7 percent to $421 million, reflecting lower revenues from natural gas operations.

Berkshire also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Brooks athletic shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.

The company ended the quarter with $63.71 billion of cash, enough to fund one or more giant acquisitions.

It will own a roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co after H.J. Heinz Co, now owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, buys Kraft Foods Group Inc, combining Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta and other brands under one roof.

Major stock holdings, meanwhile, include American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co.

In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $2,400 at $215,800, and its Class B shares rose $2.15 to $143.36.

The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set last Dec. 8. Berkshire's market value is roughly $355 billion, ranking fifth among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday celebrated Warren Buffett's 50th anniversary running the conglomerate, as the billionaire fielded questions about the company and its future, and explained some business practices.

Berkshire owns more than 80 companies including the Burlington Northern railroad, Geico car insurance, Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and See's candies, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks.

But Buffett's status as an investing legend, and his plain talk and humor, are key reasons why people trek to Omaha for what Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists."

Berkshire's annual meeting is Omaha's top annual draw other than baseball's College World Series - reflected in hotel rooms that can fetch more than $400 a night and often sell out nearly a year in advance.

Buffett, 84, and his second-in-command Charlie Munger, 91, spend hours at the annual meeting in a downtown arena answering questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists about business, the economy, current events and life.

As is usually the case, no major controversy has been hanging over Berkshire despite its sprawl.

But Buffett did offer a defense of Berkshire's partnerships with Brazil's 3G Capital, which critics say ruthlessly cuts jobs at companies it acquires. In 2013, Berkshire and 3G bought H.J. Heinz Co, which in turn is now buying Kraft Foods Group Inc.

"The 3G people have been successful in building marvelous businesses," Buffett said. "I don't know of any company that has a policy that says we're going to have a lot more people than they need."
Buffett also offered a defense of Berkshire's Clayton Homes manufactured homes unit, which was criticized in a recent Seattle Times article for predatory sales practices that can trap low-income borrowers in homes they cannot afford.

"I make no apologies whatsoever for Clayton's lending terms," he said, adding that Clayton itself faces losses when borrowers default.

LOYAL SHAREHOLDERS

Devoted and sleep-deprived shareholders began lining up outside the venue hours before doors opened at 7 a.m. (CDT). Kyle Cleeton, a research analyst for an investment firm, may have gotten there first, saying he showed up at 10 p.m. the night before.

"I wanted to be first in line," he said. "You're not sure how many more years you're going to have."

Bill Guenther, a state forester from Brattleboro, Vermont, said, "I'm one who likes a good seat." He arrived at 1:04 a.m. despite having last year suffered a major foot injury requiring crutches when he collided with another shareholder as he tried to get that good seat.

"My girlfriend said, 'You're not going to do this again,' and I said, 'I have to, it's the 50th year.'"

Many at the meeting wondered about Buffett's future with the company but he was not expected to give any hint about who might replace him as chief executive.

"Doing so would limit his options going forward and he doesn't usually give up free options to satisfy the curiosity of the outside world," said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management LLC in New York.

The meeting was preceded by the company movie overseen by Buffett's daughter Susie, part celebration of Berkshire and its culture and part entertainment.

This year's film featured, among other things, chats between Buffett and some of Berkshire's earliest employees, and a spoof championship boxing match directed by John Landis between Buffett, billing himself as "The Berkshire Bomber," and the undefeated welterweight champ Floyd Mayweather.

But the weekend is mainly about commerce. Shareholders at the arena bought 10,000 frozen bars and 2,000 Blizzards at Dairy Queen on a Friday shopping day. They could also buy an array of products as varied as blindingly yellow "new and improved" "Berky" boxer shorts for men and "Berky Bras" for women (both $6), or carpet cleaner from Berkshire's Kirby unit (also $5).

Buffett as usual milled about the displays prior to the meeting, trailed by dozens of print and TV journalists, where he ate (and paid for) a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar, and tossed newspapers as he once did as a boy. Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp chairman and Berkshire director, tossed one too.

General Electric Co on Monday announced collaborations with Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc as it uses digital technology and the growing appetite for data to reinvigorate its 130-year-old lighting business.

With chipmaker Qualcomm, GE is offering retailers a way to connect with shoppers' smartphones through technology embedded in LED light bulbs, the company said. One use of the "indoor positioning" technology could be to transmit customized coupons to shoppers depending on their store location.

GE also said it will produce an LED bulb compatible with Apple's yet-to-launch connected-device platform HomeKit. The bulb can change colors to align with the natural rhythms of the body.

The tie-ups underscore GE's plans to dive into the emerging and increasingly competitive market for connected lighting that integrates with smart devices.

While GE sees an opportunity in selling energy-efficient LED bulbs, it will seek to use sensors and other technology embedded in LEDs to the advantage of consumers, businesses and cities, said Beth Comstock, who leads GE Business Innovations.

Services offered by GE stand to provide revenue that could offset pressure should the LED bulb business become more commoditized.

"There’s now a data stream from light that is going to create opportunity to be more productive," said Comstock, in her first interview about the lighting strategy since September, when the unit became part of GE's innovations division.

GE itself is undergoing a sweeping overhaul, jettisoning the bulk of its finance division to focus on big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines.

Some analysts have speculated the U.S. conglomerate will divest lighting after deciding last year to sell its appliances segment and moves by Siemens and Philips to hive off lighting units. GE Lighting totaled about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, 2.3 percent of the company's overall industrial sales.

Comstock said lighting fits smoothly with GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's desire to marry software and analytics with GE's various industrial equipment, which GE calls the "Industrial Internet."

"LEDs plus software, it helps GE continue its Industrial Internet expansion and I think the lighting business has a big role in GE's future because of that," Comstock said.

Along with traditional lighting manufacturers, the "intelligent lighting" market is drawing companies that manage other building controls such as Honeywell, and start-ups focused on lighting controls, according to Jesse Foote, analyst at Navigant Research.

"There are so many kinds of companies getting into the space," Foote said.

The bull market "supercycle" for stocks and bonds is approaching an end, as the unconventional monetary policies that have bolstered asset prices since the financial crisis are running out, widely followed investor Bill Gross said on Monday.

The attempt by global central banks to cure a debt crisis with more debt doesn't have much further to run, which will end a rally that's lasted three and a half decades, Gross said in an investment outlook for Janus Capital Group Inc..

"Credit based oxygen is running out," Gross wrote in the outlook titled, "A Sense of an Ending," in which he compared the final stages of the financial market cycle with his own mortality.

Gross, who turned 71 in April, wrote: "A 70-year-old reads the obituaries with a self-awareness, as opposed to an item of interest. Some point out that this heightened intensity should make the moment all the more precious and therein lies the challenge: Make it so; make it precious; savor what you have done – family, career, giving back – the 'accumulation' that (British author) Julian Barnes speaks to."

Gross, manager of the $1.5 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, has made similar warnings on stocks and bonds before and acknowledged they've come too early.

In May 2013, Gross, who at the time was manager of the Pimco Total Return Fund, the world's largest bond fund, jolted Wall Street participants on social media with a Twitter post saying: "The secular 30-yr bull market in bonds likely ended 4/29/2013."

On Monday, Gross said successful managers who are neither permanently optimistic or pessimistic on the market have spoken to a "sense of an ending" as well.

"Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Ray Dalio, Jeremy Grantham, among others, warn investors that our 35-year investment supercycle may be exhausted."

Gross recommended that investors should stop focusing on price appreciation and, instead, look to "mildly levered income," such as his recommendation to short German government debt.

"I merely have a sense of an ending, a secular bull market ending with a whimper, not a bang. But if so, like death, only the timing is in doubt," Gross said.

David Schawel, vice president and portfolio manager of Square 1 Financial, said about Gross's latest prognostication: "I think it's obvious that going forward, returns are going to be lower across asset classes. However, it's proven very difficult to guess the timing, as the last few years have shown."

General Electric's (GE.N) CEO will meet Europe's antitrust chief on Tuesday, according to a source, in what is expected to be a push for unconditional EU approval for its 12.4-billion-euro ($13.8 billion) bid for an Alstom (ALSO.PA) business.

Jeff Immelt will meet European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday afternoon, said the source, declining to provide details.

Commission spokeswoman Lucia Caudet confirmed the meeting: "Commissioner Vestager will meet Mr Immelt tomorrow as part of the Commission's ongoing merger review."

GE is seeking to convince the Commission to approve its proposal to buy French company Alstom's power equipment business, without having to make concessions, other sources told Reuters.

GE has until next month to offer concessions if it cannot convince the EU enforcer.

The EU's competition authority, which is due to decide on the deal by Aug. 6, has warned of possible price rises because the merger would remove one of GE's three main rivals in the manufacturing of heavy-duty turbines for gas-fired power plants.

The two companies compete with Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, a joint venture formed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Hitachi (6501.T). Italian peer Ansaldo (STS.MI) is seen as a niche player.

Immelt met EU energy chief Arias Canete, EU internal market chief Elzbieta Bienkowska and EU research and science chief Carlos Moedas in Strasbourg last week.

Speaking to analysts on a conference call last month, the CEO said his company expected the Alstom deal to close in the second half of the year and backed it as a "good strategic and financial fit". But he said that, like any deal, "if this one ever would become unattractive, we wouldn't do it".

The Alstom deal, which would be the biggest acquisition in GE's history, stands to expand GE's installed base of power turbines, which would allow the U.S. company to earn more revenue from servicing the equipment.

GE has said it expected Alstom to add about 1 cent per share in earnings this year, and between 6 cents to 9 cents in 2016. Those earnings could be even more important given GE's new plan to divest most of its finance assets over the next few years.

GE has a checkered history with the Commission, the EU executive, which blocked its planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International (HON.N) in 2001 but has since cleared more than 50 deals.

Recent setbacks for prosecutors in a huge corruption scheme at Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) suggest they will struggle to win as many convictions as they seek.

The Supreme Court's decision last week to release from jail nine executives at construction companies suspected of paying bribes in the scheme, and put them under house arrest instead, reduces the chances of prosecutors convincing them to strike plea bargain deals that could result in additional charges.

The ruling, and a separate decision by the court to halt some new depositions, suggest defense efforts to poke holes in the investigation, often by citing procedural issues, are starting to bear fruit.

To be sure, legal experts do expect more convictions in the case in which former executives at Petrobras, as the company is known, and some of its suppliers are accused of inflating the value of service contracts and funneling the excess funds into their own bank accounts and to political parties, including that of President Dilma Rousseff. (Graphic on the alleged corruption scheme: reut.rs/1GQrMVf)

Rousseff is not being investigated, but her ratings have suffered because of her party's ties to the scandal and fears that economic fallout from the investigation will tip Brazil into recession this year.

Prosecutors say bank records and witness testimony show at least 2.1 billion reais ($700 million) was embezzled. The probe has already led to 97 indictments, including four former Petrobras executives, the senior engineering executives, and the treasurer of Rousseff's Workers' Party.

Dozens of elected officials have also been implicated in a separate investigation in Brasilia.

The first eight convictions came on April 22, including a former Petrobras executive and a black-market money dealer, who were sentenced to a year of house arrest and three years in jail, respectively.

Yet the recent Supreme Court decisions suggest prosecutors may struggle to reach their stated goal of presenting more charges and sending scores of politicians and executives to jail to change the way corruption is treated and punished in Brazil.

"It's going to be hard to get these convictions," said Luiz Flavio Gomes, a criminal lawyer and director of the Avante Institute, an anti-crime organization in Sao Paulo, citing Brazil's "precarious justice system" and the recent release of some defendants.

In ordering the release of the nine executives, the Supreme Court rejected federal judge Sergio Moro's argument that the suspects could commit more crimes unless they were locked up.

Moro, who is guiding the prosecution, has not publicly commented on the ruling. But keeping the executives in jail was seen as key to pressuring them to reveal what they knew about the graft and bring about more indictments.

A lawyer for the vice president of construction firm Camargo Corrêa told Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that "the number of plea bargains will likely fall" because of the ruling.

    

UNTOUCHABLES

Since the scandal first broke last year, the investigation has enjoyed broad support among Brazilians who believe endemic graft and bribery keep their resource-rich country from reaching its full potential.

The 42-year-old, telegenic Moro and a group of nine prosecutors in the southern city of Curitiba, where much of the investigation is carried out, have become celebrities. A photo of the prosecutors with the headline "The Untouchables" ran on the front page of Folha a few weeks ago.

Yet some warn the publicity may have inflated expectations. 

"Because of the size of the investigation and the amount of media attention it generates ... you almost end up assuming (the defendants) are guilty," said Tatiana Farina, an economist affiliated with the University of Sao Paulo.

Moro and the prosecutors declined to be interviewed for this story. They have previously defended their tactics, including the use of plea bargains, as permitted under Brazilian law and necessary to crack a case as big as Petrobras.

One prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, has spoken of the opportunity to spur a "social transformation" by showing that corruption will not be tolerated.

One major obstacle, however, is the justice system itself.

Courts often have unclear or overlapping jurisdictions, making them prone to small procedural errors.

Defense lawyers argue that key elements of the case should be heard not under Moro's jurisdiction in Curitiba but in Rio de Janeiro, where Petrobras is based.

Leonardo Sica, the president of the Sao Paulo bar association, said that argument could get some of Moro's rulings thrown out in coming months.

Defense lawyers also say they plan to continue pushing back against Moro's "preventive jailing," of suspects before they have been sentenced or even formally charged. Moro has justified the measure with flight risk and potential threat to public order posed by the suspects.

Andre Azevedo, member of the legal team representing jailed lobbyist Fernando Soares, who is accused of funneling bribes to politicians, said the practice violates the American Convention on Human Rights, which Brazil signed.

"We have a list of cases that were thrown out in Brazil for these types of excesses," he told Reuters. He called the Supreme Court's decision to free some executives a "huge blow" to Moro.

The Supreme Court's recent rulings also suggest it is reluctant to give the Moro a free rein.

That matters because elected officials enjoy special protection, which means 34 politicians, including the leaders of both houses of Congress, who have been named as possible suspects must be tried before the Supreme Court.

To win convictions, prosecutors will have to prove the money was originally stolen from Petrobras since companies can legally give to electoral campaigns in Brazil and the engineering firms did complete work for Petrobras, albeit at an elevated cost.

"It's not so clear that these were bribes," said Alberto Toron, the defense lawyer who secured the executives’ release order and represents the head of construction firm UTC, who is accused of corruption and money laundering.

The Workers' Party says the donations were legal and duly accounted for with Brazil's electoral authority. Rousseff has denied any knowledge of the scandal.

Janaina Paschoal, an attorney and professor at the University of Sao Paulo law school, said she was concerned that just like in one past corruption case, executives might get jail time, but most politicians would get off lightly.

That "would be terrible for society," she said. "I, unlike many, don't see the executives as the biggest villains in this scandal."

Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who often moves a stock simply by speaking its name, on Monday kicked off the year's most prominent investment conference by laying out a case against oil frackers, arguing these companies drill "lots and lots of holes" and burn through plenty of cash.

Einhorn, who often unveils so-called short-bets against companies at these events, cited Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) as a particular offender at the 20th annual Sohn Investment Conference. "We call it the motherfracker," he said, prompting investors to kick the share price down as much as 5.3 percent. The company should trade closer to $78 a share, he said, not the $166.50 the stock is trading at now.

"Pioneer is burning cash and its reserves are not growing," said Einhorn, who runs $11 billion Greenlight Capital, adding "Pioneer ought to stop touting estimates based on stale pricing." The company is losing 20 cents of present value for every dollar it invests.

Last year Einhorn unveiled a short bet against athenahealth Inc (ATHN.O) at a previous Sohn conference and was the first to underscore problems at Lehman Brothers months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy.

Einhorn was one of the few investors at the conference who unveiled a short bet with most other investors putting forth ideas that investors can buy and hold.

Activist investor Barry Rosenstein discussed two investment ideas that were already well known on Wall Street: His bets on drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).

Leon Cooperman, who runs Omega Advisors and has long been saying the stock market would continue to climb, stuck by his bullish outlook, saying the stock market can still end higher this year. "If there is a bubble out there, it is not in the stock market," Cooperman said, adding it may be in the fixed income market.

He pitched a handful of U.S.-based companies including Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N), Priceline Group Inc (PCLN.O) and drugmaker Actavis Plc (ACT.N).

Picking up on the pharmaceutical industry theme, Larry Robbins, who runs Glenview Capital Management, pitched AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) saying the stock price could double. The company's price is relatively cheap and management is disciplined, Robbins said.

Even though AbbVie called off a planned $55 billion takeover of Shire late last year, industry analysts are still holding out forecasts that the breakneck pace of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry will continue. The company could be taken over or it could be the one taking over someone else, Robbins said.

Keith Meister, a former Carl Icahn lieutenant who now runs $8 billion Corvex Management, touted fast food restaurant chain Yum Brands (YUM.N), saying his firm is one of the five largest investors and that the company is Corvex's second-biggest investment ever. On Friday Daniel Loeb's Third Point said it had taken a significant stake in Yum.

Meister said Yum should spin off its China business, allowing a fully independent China company that appeals to the nation's large middle class. He said Yum's share could trade at least at $130, compared with the current price of $92.25, after the company spins off the China operation.

For visitors to the Sohn Conference, a virtual who's who of the $3 trillion hedge fund industry held at New York's Avery Fisher Hall, the draw is getting new ideas to put into a portfolio at a time stock-picking is getting ever tougher after a multi-year bull market.

Hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said he has not adjusted his portfolio in months and is looking for inspiration for fresh positions. "I'm a man of action and I'm hoping to get some good ideas here."

McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) new chief executive officer said on Monday he would reorganize business units, sell restaurants to franchisees and cut costs in a bid to turn the fast-food chain into a "modern, progressive burger company."

The anticipated video announcement by CEO Steve Easterbrook left investors hungry for specific details on how the world's biggest restaurant chain would try to improve consumer perceptions of food quality and slow service.

"I will not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business," said Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, following one of McDonald's most dismal years on record.

Shares were down nearly 2 percent in premarket trading, then retraced losses to stand off 0.1 percent at $97.70 on the New York Stock Exchange as investors digested the news.
"Judging by the immediate investor reaction, there appears to be more of a 'prove it' sentiment among investors, rather than an full embrace of Mr. Easterbrook's plan," Miller Tabak & Co analyst Stephen Anderson said in a client note.

Easterbrook said McDonald's will sell 3,500 restaurants to franchisees by 2018, taking global franchisee ownership to 90 percent from 81 percent. McDonald's prior plan called for selling 1,500 restaurants by 2016.

He vowed to remove "cumbersome" management and scour the business for inefficiencies to find about $300 million in net annual savings, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017.

Easterbrook also said McDonald's would return $8 billion to $9 billion to shareholders in 2015.

McDonald's currently organizes its business around major geographic markets: the United States, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA).

Easterbrook said the new segments, which become effective July 1, will be organized around business similarities.

The U.S. market, which accounts for more than 40 percent of McDonald's operating income, will continue to be led by Mike Andres.

The new "international lead" market will include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, which make up a total of 40 percent of McDonald's operating income. It will be led by Doug Goare, current president of McDonald's Europe.

Dave Hoffman, now president of McDonald's APMEA unit, will lead a new "high-growth" market that includes China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Those countries account for about 10 percent of operating income.

The "foundational" market includes the remaining countries where McDonald's operates. It will be run by Ian Borden, currently APMEA's chief financial officer.

Wall Street ended higher on Monday as corporate earnings came in better than feared, although shares of McDonald's declined after the fast-food chain's turnaround plan left investors wanting more.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) rose 1.62 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after the insurance and investment conglomerate's results beat forecasts.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 46.34 points, or 0.26 percent, to end at 18,070.4, and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.2 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,114.49, just shy of its record-high close of 2,117.69 on April 24.

The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.54 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,016.93.

“This is being driven by a lack of substantial negative news,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. “Things in Europe seem pretty calm, we haven’t heard anything out of China, and against that backdrop, some of the earnings reports are looking better.”

Cognizant (CTSH.O) surged 6.15 percent after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast.

Seven of the 10 S&P sectors were positive, with the financials index .SPSY gaining 0.98 percent and the utilities index .SPLRCU 0.73 percent higher, with investors attracted by relatively high dividends.

With three-quarters of corporate earnings reports in, Wall Street is now trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint.

While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year.

Monday's rally in utilities suggested some investors believe the Fed will not raise rates soon and may be looking for yield, Jankovskis said. The S&P utilities index has a dividend yield of 3.7 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 2.4 percent dividend yield.

McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) closed 1.71 percent lower after its plan to turn the fast-food chain into a "modern, progressive burger company" failed to impress shareholders.

Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) fell 1.88 percent and the S&P 500 energy index .SPNY lost 1.39 percent after David Einhorn, the influential head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, said at a conference that oil fracking companies can "contaminate portfolio returns."

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,758 to 1,287, for a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,593 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.38-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 55 new highs and 35 new lows.

About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.2 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers will step down in July after 20 years at the helm of the network equipment maker, a symbol of the dot.com stock boom 15 years ago now struggling to boost its bottom line in the era of cloud computing.

Company veteran Chuck Robbins, 49, will take over as CEO. The 65-year-old Chambers, one of the longest-serving leaders of a Silicon Valley company and also company chairman, will become executive chairman, the company said on Monday.

Wall Street analysts said a change was expected and could signal a refocusing of Cisco, which acquired dozens of companies under Chambers but has failed to make great headway outside its core networking business.

"In many cases where the CEO has been very acquisitive, the next guy pares down and refocuses the company, and that is what I would be expecting with this change," said Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

Robbins did not immediately indicate where that focus would be. "Over the next 90 days, I (would) actually like to listen," he told reporters on a conference call. "The market is moving too rapidly for any one individual to think they have all the answers."

Shares of Cisco, based in San Jose, California with about 70,000 staff, were up 0.4 percent at $29.24 on Nasdaq.

The company became a stock market sensation at the height of the technology boom in March 2000 when its market value passed $600 billion, based on the company’s diluted share count at the time, and briefly topped that of Microsoft Corp.

Chambers never managed to revive those glory days despite forays into consumer electronics and other areas. Cisco's market value is now about $150 billion, and its annual operating profit is around where it was five years ago. It is expected to post sales of $49 billion this year.
Cisco said the timing of the announcement was not related to its quarterly earnings report, scheduled for May 13, and it did not alter its financial outlook.

Chambers, a prominent Republican backer who was a co-chair for Senator John McCain's 2008 bid for president, did not indicate any plans to go into politics.

"I will probably support people (for) political office but probably not get involved myself," he told reporters.

Chambers said he started thinking about retiring as CEO about three years ago. He seemed relaxed and joked with longtime colleague Robbins during the call.

"Chuck is just an execution machine," said Chambers, using business jargon for someone who gets things done.

Robbins joined Cisco in 1997 and became a board member on Friday.

His latest role has been senior vice president of worldwide operations, running global sales for the company. Analysts hope Robbins' elevation will mean a renewed focus on sales.

"We like that Cisco is appointing someone as CEO that has a strong sales background, and we expect the employee base to be very supportive of the appointment," said Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.

Cisco has been looking for a new CEO for the past 16 months, board member Roderick McGeary wrote in a company blog post detailing the hiring process. (bit.ly/1JLIPup)

Some industry watchers were surprised at the choice. Rob Lloyd, Cisco's director of development and sales, was more visible to investors, JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said in an interview.

Chambers declined to name other potential candidates, or whether any such as Lloyd would stay at the company. Lloyd did not immediately return a request for comment.

Chambers is the second high-profile U.S. technology executive to step aside from the top job in the past eight months. In September, database software maker Oracle Corp's CEO, Larry Ellison, announced his plan to become executive chairman.

Chambers has increased Cisco sales to about $48 billion from $1.2 billion since he became CEO in 1995.

General Motors Co's (GM.N) chief executive said on Monday she is confident the company will convince investors of the value of holding on to GM's stock, which has dropped nearly 9 percent since mid-March despite a $5 billion share buyback plan.

The automaker's shares have declined as investors are concerned the U.S. auto cycle has peaked, analysts said. The company makes its profit in North America and in China, where margins are likely to be squeezed.

"This is a business that is not made on a quarter-by-quarter basis," CEO Mary Barra told reporters at a roundtable interview at GM's assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas.

"We just need to continue to have strong performance, which we did in the first quarter, quarter after quarter, year after year, focus on the right products, the right technology, quality and our customers and over time, we will earn that reputation."

Barra spoke at the Fairfax Assembly plant, where she led a celebration to mark the company producing the 500 millionth vehicle in its history.

Alan Batey, GM's North American president, told Fairfax workers and Kansas politicians that the company will invest $174 million in the plant for new equipment and technology to produce the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. That vehicle will go on sale later this year.

The investment is part of GM's plan to spend $5.4 billion at its U.S. plants over the next three years.

GM shares were up 0.5 percent at $35.58 on Monday afternoon. That compares with $33 at the post-bankruptcy initial public offering in 2010. GM announced the $5 billion share buyback in March to appease frustrated investors.

Barra said she has not met with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne and that GM will continue to follow its own plan regarding investing in product development.

She also said GM will continue to work with partners in particular areas, such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T) for fuel cell development and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (600104.SS) in China.

Barra declined to discuss U.S. labor costs in detail. The company and the United Auto Workers union enter contact talks this summer.

"We’re going to work very hard in constructive problem-solving with our union partners to make sure we have agreements that are good for the company, good for the workers, allow us to maintain our competitiveness," she said.

With U.S. inflation uncomfortably low and the unemployment rate still too high, the Federal Reserve should hold off on raising short-term interest rates until early next year, a top Fed policymaker said on Monday.

Still, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said, rate hikes could begin this year without harming the recovery.

"My preference would be that we not raise rates until we're confident that we are going to see rates rise, and those rate increases be clearly in train," he told reporters after a speech here. "However having said that, it is the overall stance of monetary policy over a longer period of time that will ultimately be determinative, so a properly shallow path of increases, even if we were to increase rates sooner than I would like, could still be quite supportive of continued strong economic recovery, hopefully continued increases in inflation."

The Fed can achieve its goals without any additional stimulus like a new bond-buying program, "as long as people sort of understand that we could go above 2 percent, that would be perfectly fine, as long as it is in a controlled sense, not anything outsized or too long-lasting, but neither would it have to be only three months, that type of thing."

A voting member this year on the U.S. central bank's policy-setting panel, Evans told the group that while the subdued job gains across America in March were likely transitory, unemployment at 5.5 percent is still about a half a percentage point higher than it ought to be.

More pressing in his view, inflation has been running below the Fed's 2-percent target for years, and is likely to take until 2018 before it returns to that target, he said.

"I likely will not feel confident enough to begin to raise rates until early next year," he told the Columbus Economic Development Board. "I think if we top out during this cycle with inflation not getting to 2 percent that's going to be a problem for us longer term," he told reporters afterward.

Evans is among the most dovish policymakers at the table with Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who must manage the delicate task of deciding when to raise U.S. interest rates for the first time since 2006.

Most Fed officials, including Yellen, expect economic conditions will be ripe for higher interest rates sometime this year.

 New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.

The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.

"It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year," said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.

New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.

Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.

The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.

Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms.

That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.

The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.

The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.

Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices.

Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar.

The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.

"Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession," said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices."

Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines.

Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett defended some of his core holdings in a televised interview on Monday, but reiterated that equities in general would look expensive in an environment with normal interest rates.

The remarks from Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), come as several of his core holdings, including International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), have showed declining revenue trends in recent years.

Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire had bought more shares of IBM during the first quarter, and forecast higher earnings at the company over the next 10 years.

He also praised IBM's stock buyback program, which he said had been "enormously beneficial" for shareholders, though he stressed that in general, buyback programs should be done based on share price and not as an all-purpose strategy.

Coca-Cola continues to have a "strong competitive position," he said.

Referring to the broader market, Buffett said equity valuation would appear "on the high side" if interest rates were normalized from their currently low levels, while U.S. bonds currently appear "very overvalued."

The comments on equity valuation repeated remarks he had made over the weekend at an annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.

While he acknowledged that investors expect interest rates to rise this year, Buffett said it would be difficult for the United States to raise rates "significantly" if European rates remain low.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's "hands are somewhat tied" by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi with respect to interest rates, he said.

Buffett also commented on the recent strength in the U.S. dollar, as well as the state of the euro zone, two key issues for Wall Street investors.

He predicted that the European Union "more likely than not" would exist in 20 years, though it could have different members than it currently does, a possible reference to Greece's current difficulties.

Speaking about the dollar, Buffett said that given a choice between the U.S. dollar and a basket of other currencies, he would prefer the dollar over the next 10 years.

Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and a Berkshire director, told CNBC he would prefer the Chinese yuan over the same period of time.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed Barclays Plc(BARC.L) to claim about $4 billion of disputed assets as part of its hurried purchase of much of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's[LEHRG.UL] brokerage unit at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.

The U.S. top court declined to hear an appeal filed by Lehman's creditors, leaving intact an August 2014 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that went in favor of Barclays.

Barclays already had control of $3.5 billion of the disputed $4 billion.

Trustee James Giddens has been seeking to recoup money for the brokerage's creditors, including Lehman affiliates and hedge funds. Lehman had been Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank. It had $639 billion of assets when it filed for Chapter 11 protection on Sept. 15, 2008, making its bankruptcy by far the biggest in U.S. history.

Barclays won court approval to buy much of Lehman's brokerage business at a Sept. 19, 2008, hearing overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan.

A dispute remained, however, over how to dispose of various "cash" assets of the brokerage. These included the $4 billion of margin assets held by third parties to support a Lehman exchange-traded derivatives business.

Also in dispute was $1.9 billion of "clearance box" assets used to process securities trades, although that was not part of the Supreme Court appeal.

In February 2011, Peck said Barclays was entitled to the clearance box assets but not the margin assets. But in July 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan partially reversed him, and said Barclays deserved both. The appeals court upheld that decision.

"We are disappointed but remain focused on continued progress in winding-down and closing out" the Lehman Brothers estate, said Kent Jarrell, a spokesman for Giddens. "The trustee appropriately reserved for the Barclays litigation, so the decision does not impact distributions already completed or assets on hand for potential additional distributions to unsecured general creditors."

Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) plans to hold a shareholder vote on the change the board made in October to company bylaws to allow Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan to also be chairman.

The vote, to be held no later than 2016, is in response to comments from shareholders since the board made the change on its own, according to a letter sent to shareholders on Monday by Moynihan and Jack Bovender, the lead independent director on the board.

The board's action in October had reversed a move by the company during the financial crisis to have separate people be CEO and chairman.

The announcement of a vote on the change comes two days before the company's annual shareholder meeting, to be held in Charlotte on Wednesday.

Ahead of the meeting, shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co issued reports that criticized how the board had changed the bylaws on its own. They recommended votes against the re-election of one or more members of the board's governance committee.

The advisory firms, however, recommended that Moynihan be re-elected to the board this year.

Stock analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA, who plans to attend Wednesday's shareholder meeting, has also called for votes against directors on the governance committee.

"We appreciate the candor with which stockholders have shared their insights, both in support of the decision and in expressing reservations about the process," the letter from Moynihan and Bovender said.

Brent oil hit a 2015 high before settling down with U.S. crude on Monday as Saudi Arabia's plan to halt bombing in Yemen eased tensions over the security of oil Middle East supplies.

A stronger dollar, following the largest U.S. factory orders in eight months, had also weighed on crude. [FRX/]

Even so, the price drop was cushioned by data from market intelligence firm Genscape showing a further tightening in supplies at the U.S. crude storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.

UK Brent crude LCOc1, the more widely used global oil benchmark, touched the year's high of $67.10 before settling down just a penny at $66.45 a barrel.

A public holiday in Britain had limited trading volumes in Brent.

U.S. crude CLc1 settled down 22 cents at $58.93.

A Saudi-led Arab alliance, waging an air campaign against Houthi fighters in Yemen, was considering calling a truce to allow humanitarian relief, Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television quoted the country's foreign minister as saying.

"The reducing of tensions in Yemen and the Middle East was certainly a negative to the geopolitics around oil today," said Phil Flynn, analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.

"But the Cushing draws have allowed retreating bulls to keep a foot in the market as those continue to play into the theme of tightening U.S. production."

Genscape reported a drop of about 120,000 barrels in Cushing supply in the four days to April 28, said traders who saw the data.

After crude prices were halved from last summer's highs above $100 on concerns over a global glut, the market sprang back last month, surging 20 percent to 25 percent on speculation the oversupply in U.S. crude may be starting to ease.

Oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc added to that notion on Friday by saying the number of U.S. rigs actively drilling for oil had fallen for a record 21 weeks in a row.

Still, a Reuters poll on Monday suggested commercial crude stockpiles had risen nearly 2 million barrels last week, building for a record 17th straight week. Industry group American Petroleum Institute will issue on Tuesday its own expectations for last week's stockpiles, before official data released by the government's Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.

Middle East and North African oil output are also plentiful, with higher Libyan exports, record Iraqi shipment in April and OPEC output that is at its highest in 2-1/2 years.

China's factories suffered their fastest drop in activity in a year in April as new orders shrank, a private business survey showed on Monday, hardening the case for fresh stimulus measures to halt a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The latest indication of deepening factory woes raises the risk that second-quarter economic growth may dip below 7 percent for the first time since the depths of the global crisis, adding to official fears of job losses and local-level debt defaults.

The HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.9 in April - the lowest level since April 2014 - from 49.6 in March, as demand faltered and deflationary pressures persisted.

The number was weaker than a preliminary reading of 49.2, and below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction compared with the previous month.

"China's manufacturing sector had a weak start to Q2, with total new business declining at the quickest rate in a year while production stagnated," said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at Markit.

"The PMI data indicate that more stimulus measures may be required to ensure the economy doesn't slow from the 7 percent annual growth rate seen in Q1.”

The overall new orders sub-index dipped to 48.7 in April, the sharpest contraction in a year. That suggested a marked deterioration in domestic demand, as new export orders showed tentative signs of improvement.

Both input and output prices declined for a ninth month, while manufacturers shed jobs for an 18th month, auguring poorly for an economy that grew at its weakest rate for six years in the first quarter.

An official survey released on Friday showed China's factories struggled to grow in April as domestic and export demand remained weak. The official number of 50.1 was the weakest reading for the month of April since the data started in 2005, HSBC noted.

The private survey focuses on small and mid-sized firms, while the official one looks at larger, state-owned companies.

China will release its April economic data over the coming weeks, starting with trade on Friday.

GROWTH COOLING

Aside from weakness in the manufacturing sector, China is struggling with a downturn in its property market, slowing investment and high levels of domestic debt.

On Thursday, the Politburo, the ruling Communist Party's top decision-making body, said that authorities will step up policy "adjustments" and urged further tax cuts. It also said the government must resolve financing glitches that are holding up big infrastructure projects.

Analysts believe the Politburo's emphasis on stabilizing growth signaled top leaders' increasing concerns about a sharper slowdown.

Economic growth is expected to slow further to 6.8 percent in the second quarter from 7 percent in the previous quarter, the State Information Center, a top government think tank, said in a research report published on Monday.

Millions of workers lost their jobs when China's growth tumbled to 6.6 percent in early 2009. A massive stimulus package pulled the economy out of the slump, but at the cost of saddling local governments with a mountain of debt.

The think-tank, which is affiliated to the National Development and Reform Commision, the top planning agency, called for interest rate cuts of 50 basis points in the first half, coupled with reductions in banks' reserves requirements.

The People's Bank of China last cut benchmark interest rates by 25 bps on Feb. 28 - its second cut since November.

The central bank has also reduced banks' reserve requirements (RRR) twice this year, by a total of 150 basis points, in a bid to boost their lending power, while home purchase rules have been eased to help the real estate market.

The think-tank also urged the government to lower the yuan currency's real effective exchange rate by 1-2 percent this year to help boost exports.

"Underlying economic activity appears to have slowed further from March, warranting more aggressive easing measures in the coming weeks in order for the economy to stabilize toward mid-year," Julia Wang, China economist at HSBC, said in a note.

Wang also expects a 25-bps rate cut in the second quarter.

Most economists believe China's economic growth could cool to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014.

Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board will on Monday discuss finding a new chairman to fill the void left by Ferdinand Piech's shock departure last month, sources told Reuters.

VW's 20-member controlling panel, led by interim chairman Berthold Huber, will meet in the German town of Hanover ahead of what is likely to become a tense shareholder meeting on Tuesday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

It's unlikely that the board -- evenly split between investor and labor representatives -- will reach a decision on a new chairman, one source said, declining to be more specific. Interim chairman Huber is a former boss of the IG Metall labor union and is not seen as a candidate for the role on a permanent basis.

"The search for a successor to Piech at the top of the supervisory board has the utmost priority for investors," said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which holds 0.6 percent of VW preference shares.

"The ideal candidate needs a high degree of automotive expertise and authority and should if possible be from outside the company and be neutral," Speich said.

VW, Europe's largest carmaker, and the works council have declined comment on potential candidates mentioned in the press.

These include long-time automotive manager Wolfgang Reitzle and Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), the holding company owned by the Porsche and Piech families which controls a majority stake in VW.

VW last week sought to shift the focus back to its operating business by appointing two nieces of Piech to replace the former VW patriarch and his wife on the board. Piech's wife Ursula had also quit on April 25.
But Piech has challenged VW's choice, which has also been backed by the works council, and instead proposed Reitzle and former Siemens (SIEGn.DE) manager Brigitte Ederer, German daily newspaper Bild reported.

The 78-year-old Piech, a dominant figure at VW for more than two decades, quit after losing a power struggle with Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn.

Wide differences over pension and labor reforms continued to dog intensive negotiations between Greece's leftist government and its international creditors despite progress in other areas as the country's cash position becomes increasingly critical.

Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis sounded the alarm on Monday, saying that while Athens intended to meet all its payment obligations, including nearly 1 billion euros to the IMF in May, it needed fresh funds before the end of the month.

"Liquidity is a pressing issue," Sakellaridis told a news conference. "The Greek government is not waiting until the end of May for a liquidity injection. It expects this liquidity to be offered to the Greek economy as soon as possible."

In a sign of Greece's increasingly frantic efforts to secure relief, Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis will travel to Frankfurt to hold talks with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Tuesday, a government official said.

With lenders ruling out fresh aid until Athens implements all required reforms, Greece is hoping progress in negotiations will pave the way for the ECB to permit Greek banks to buy more short-term treasury bills, easing the government's cash crunch.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras spoke over the phone with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Monday to discuss the progress of the negotiations. The government gave no details of the call.

Intensive talks on an interim deal between a reshuffled Greek negotiating team and representatives of the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF, renamed the "Brussels Group", have been under way since last Thursday.

The aim had been to achieve a technical-level accord that would enable euro zone finance ministers to declare when they meet on May 11 that there is a prospect of concluding the bailout review successfully. But the two sides remain at loggerheads over several issues.
Labour Minister Panos Skourletis said the International Monetary Fund, Greece's second biggest creditor after euro zone governments, was insisting on tough policy conditions for an interim deal to unlock frozen bailout aid.

The global lender was unyielding in demands for pensions cuts, rules to ease mass layoffs of private sector workers and opposition to a government plan to raise the minimum wage, Skourletis told Mega TV.

"They are asking us to not touch anything (of the austerity measures) that have ruined Greek people's lives in the last five years," he said.

"The IMF is the most inflexible side ... the most extreme voices of the Brussels Group," the minister said. "But there are also calmer voices."

Greece faces repayments to the IMF totaling 970 million euros by May 12. It has been borrowing from municipalities and government entities to meet obligations.

Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis will also travel to Paris and Brussels on Tuesday to meet his French counterpart as well as EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici.

"RED LINES"

A poll conducted by the University of Macedonia for Skai TV in April showed that if the negotiations reached a deadlock and the government resorted to a referendum, more than 66 percent of Greeks would vote in favor of the euro currency. About 55 percent of those polled said they were in favor the euro even if this came with austerity.

On Sunday, Greek and euro zone officials reported progress on some issues and forecast a result by Wednesday, when the ECB holds its weekly review of emergency lending to Greek banks.

A euro zone official said there was more convergence on some areas than others. Skourletis made clear that social policies which Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' radical Syriza party has declared "red lines" were the main stumbling block.

Tsipras yielded some ground last week on privatizations and reforming Value Added Tax when he shook up his negotiating team to sideline outspoken Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who will represent Athens at next week's crucial Eurogroup meeting.

"There is more competence, more willingness to compromise and more preparedness - data, numbers, etc," said an EU official familiar with the talks. But to say there would be a deal by May 11 would be "speculation", the official added.

Greek daily Kathimerini said the ECB would consider this week significantly toughening the terms on which the banks receive emergency liquidity from the Greek central bank by raising the "haircut" on the collateral they present for funds.

Options under consideration involved reducing the face value of debt securities by 44, 65 or even 80 percent, compared to the current 23 percent, the newspaper said.

The ECB declined comment on the report, but sources familiar with the central bank's thinking said the collateral policy was unlikely to be changed this week and emergency liquidity assistance was set to be extended for another week.

"There are more positive signals from the Greek government," said a person familiar with the situation said.

The United Auto Workers said on Thursday it wants to enter new talks with Volkswagen AG VOWG-p.DE about recognizing the union as collective bargaining agent for workers at the VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said the union made a renewed pitch to the German auto group after a recent filing with U.S. labor officials showed it is supported by 55 percent of hourly workers at the plant.

The UAW wants to form a German-style works council that would include both blue-collar and white-collar workers. Casteel said Chattanooga is the only VW plant without such a works council.

In order to form the council, under U.S. labor law, the plant's hourly workers must be represented by a U.S. union with bargaining rights, in order that it not be perceived as a company union.

Casteel said the union has no plans to call for another election by plant workers. In February 2014, hourly workers rejected the UAW by a 712-626 count.

VW officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

U.S. stocks moved higher on Thursday afternoon, helped by a jump in tech stocks and a reversal in surging global interest rates.

Strong quarterly results from Alibaba as well as speculation that consumer review website Yelp.com could be for sale drove technology stocks higher, with the S&P tech index .SPLRCT up 0.87 percent.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held near a 15-year low last week, suggesting positive momentum in the economy, but not so much as to change expectations for a September interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

A recent run-up in global interest rates that has worried Wall Street also showed signs of stabilizing, while a rally in oil prices snapped.

"That drastic, draconian move in bonds and violent updraft in oil are settling a little bit and that's helping us focus on stocks," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

Investors are looking ahead to an April payroll report on Friday that could potentially affect when the Fed raises interest rates for the first time since 2006. Most of Wall Street's top banks see the Federal Reserve holding off until at least September before raising interest rates, based on Reuters' most recent poll.

At 2:16 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 118.85 points, or 0.67 percent, to 17,960.83, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.47 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,090.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 32.38 points, or 0.66 percent, to 4,952.02.

Nine of the 10 S&P 500 sectors were positive, led by the technology index.

Alibaba's (BABA.N) shares jumped 7.9 percent as the Chinese e-commerce giant reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue.

Yahoo (YHOO.O), which holds a stake in Alibaba, jumped 5.51 percent.

Yelp (YELP.N) soared 18.13 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the operator of consumer review website Yelp.com is exploring a sale.

Oil prices fell after touching their highest in 2015 on Wednesday, pushing the energy index .SPNY down 1.12 percent while lifting airline stocks.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,728 to 1,299, for a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,570 issues rose and 1,153 fell for a 1.36-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 6 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 41 new highs and 52 new lows.

Greece defied its international creditors on Thursday, refusing to cut pensions or ease layoffs to meet their demands, dimming prospects of progress next week toward securing desperately needed financial aid.

Despite efforts by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to coax leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras into moving on two key conditions for releasing EU/IMF bailout funds, the Greek government spokesman said lenders could not expect Athens to make all the concessions.

"There should not be an expectation on the part of institutions ... that the government will back down on everything," Gabriel Sakellaridis told a news conference. "When you negotiate, there should be mutual concessions.

"We won't go beyond the limits of our red lines," he said. "It's clear that we cannot cut pensions."

Athens is running out of cash but has dragged its feet on accepting unpopular reforms promised by a previous government. Negotiations have moved so slowly that the lenders have ruled out an agreement at next Monday's meeting of euro zone finance ministers.

Sakellaridis said Greek wants the Eurogroup ministers to recognize progress toward an agreement in a joint statement on Monday, giving the European Central Bank leeway to let Athens sell more short-term debt to Greek banks.

That would ease the immediate funding crunch, helping the government make a 750 million euro payment to the International Monetary Fund on May 12 and pay wages and pensions later.

However, sources familiar with the deliberations said the ECB was highly unlikely to make such a move unless the euro zone ministers set out a very strong prospect of releasing the frozen bailout funds.

"We're nowhere near that as things stand today," said an official close to the so-called Brussels Group negotiations between Greece and European Commission, ECB and IMF.

The central bank on Wednesday raised the amount of emergency liquidity assistance Greek banks can tap to counter deposit outflows and held off from tightening conditions for collateral they must present. But without a political deal, the ECB could toughen its stance in the next two weeks, the sources said.

Confidence between Athens and its euro zone partners is at a low ebb after three months of radical rhetoric, obstruction of EU and IMF officials on the ground, contradictory policy statements and obdurate negotiating tactics.

FRENETIC DIPLOMACY

In frenetic diplomacy ahead of Monday's meeting, Juncker said he discussed Greece with ECB President Mario Draghi by telephone on Thursday and would be speaking to Tsipras again later in the day, just 24 hours after their previous call.

Asked about the risk of a Greek default and exit from the currency area, the EU chief executive said: "If I were to say that "Grexit" was an option, what do you think would happen then on the financial markets?"

A Commission spokesman said the Brussels Group would continue negotiations over the weekend.

Tsipras also spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who confirmed that Moscow was ready to provide financing to Greek companies involved in a planned gas pipeline project, a Kremlin statement said. It gave no date or amount.

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, one of the hardliners in the euro zone talks, scoffed that it would be "wonderful" if Russia were to help Athens, but it would not provide as much money as Greece needs.

He said he did not have high expectations for any sort of a breakthrough at Monday's meeting.

French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, who has been trying to mediate between Athens and Berlin, the EU's main paymaster, also said a deal would not come on Monday but in the following days. Tsipras was totally engaged in seeking a solution to keep Greece in the euro zone, he said.

Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said in an interview with the French daily Le Monde that while the final deadline for a deal was the end of June, "there could also be a deadline if liquidity problems become too big for Athens".

He ruled out any discussion of debt relief for Greece until the current bailout program was successfully completed. Athens has received 240 billion euros in two bailouts since 2010, but its economy has shrunk by 25 percent, poverty has soared and a quarter of its workforce are unemployed.

Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, sidelined from the conduct of the negotiations, said in Brussels he expected a deal within days or weeks, which should include privatizations, reform of the pension system, the judiciary and value added tax.

Reprising comments that have made him a leftist hero but infuriated euro zone partners, Varoufakis said Greece should never have been given a bailout in 2010 and Germany should come to terms with the failure of the previous program.

He charged that 91 percent of the bailout funds had gone to repay mostly northern European banks.

Varoufakis also said a Greek exit from the euro was "a forbidden thought in our minds" because it would eventually bring the whole single currency project down.

The Greek parliament passed a law on Thursday allowing the rehiring about 4,000 cleaners, school guards and other public sector workers laid off or earmarked for dismissal under austerity cuts imposed by the creditors.

While not against the letter of the bailout, which allows Athens to hire one public employee for every five who leave, the move combined with the revival of shuttered public broadcaster ERT and other symbolic steps has irked euro zone negotiators.

New York's top state court on Thursday revived a bond insurer's $120 million lawsuit claiming Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lied about a pool of securities backed by subprime mortgages during the period leading up the financial crisis.

The New York Court of Appeals in a 5-2 decision said the suit by ACA Financial Guaranty Corp ACAFG.UL should move forward because the insurer had raised issues about the role of billionaire John Paulson's hedge fund in a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus.

ACA Financial said Goldman had deceived it into believing hedge fund Paulson & Co was a long investor in Abacus when it knew Paulson was betting the underlying mortgages would fail.

ACA says it lost approximately $900 million on the deal when the subprime mortgage market collapsed.

Under state law, a fraud case may only proceed if the plaintiff can show it "justifiably relied" on representations made by the defendant.

A mid-level appeals court in 2013 said ACA Financial was a sophisticated company that could have done its own research, including asking Paulson directly about its role in Abacus.

The Court of Appeals disagreed, saying ACA Financial specifically asked Goldman about Paulson's participation in the transaction and received assurances it was a long investor.

The court sent the case back to a lower appeals court to consider other issues before the suit proceeds in a state trial court in Manhattan.

Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said the firm was disappointed with the decision, but "confident that ... these contrived claims will fail”.

ACA Financial CEO Steven Berkowitz said in a statement that the company was pleased with the decision.

In dissent, Court of Appeals Judges Susan Read and Sheila Abdus-Salaam said ACA Financial could have asked more questions and requested a written assurance from Goldman.

"Instead ... ACA merely relied on what it says Goldman told it without actually checking the source," Read wrote.

In 2010 Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it misled investors in Abacus, though it did not admit wrongdoing.

ACA Financial in 2013 amended its suit to add Paulson & Co as a defendant. The hedge fund moved in state court in Manhattan to dismiss the claims, and the case was stayed, pending the appeal decided Thursday.

The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp v. Goldman Sachs & Co, New York State Court of Appeals No. 49.

Investors spooked by the "taper tantrum" of 2013, when global markets took fright at the U.S. Federal Reserve's first hint that it might taper its monetary expansion policy, take note: 2016 could be the year of the "triple taper tantrum".

That's the prediction of analysts at Morgan Stanley, who argue that the Fed, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan might all taper their super-loose monetary policies next year if growth and inflation across the three regions pick up enough.

The world's three biggest central banks are at different stages of post-crisis management, so it's a bold call. But it shows just how much markets have turned since the start of the year, when deflation was their worst fear.

"What is unknown is whether the economic situation will pan out as we see it," said Manoj Pradhan, global economist at Morgan Stanley in London and co-author of the report. "We've had a few surprises recently, but the trajectory of monetary policy and growth is leading in that direction."

The Fed has stopped its bond-buying program and its next move will almost certainly be a rate increase. The ECB has just begun a 1 trillion-euro quantitative easing program, which is set to run to September 2016. The BOJ's QE program has paused but could resume at any stage.

If growth and inflation pick up in the euro zone and Japan, however, the ECB and BOJ will not need to provide further monetary stimulus.

Pradhan says the "triple taper tantrum" is likely to pan out as follows: The Fed divests its mortgage-backed securities portfolio in the first half of 2016 and both the ECB and BOJ run down their QE programs in the second half of 2016.

"None of these are yet on investor screens in a manner that affects their investment decisions, if our conversations are anything to go by," Pradhan said.

In late May 2013, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke dropped the strongest hint to date that the Fed would begin winding down its bond purchases. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note started rising from around 1.4 percent.

Bernanke appeared to back off from those comments a month later, sparking more market volatility, particularly Treasuries. The 10-year yield rose to 1.80 percent, fell, then climbed back above 2 percent that September.

That pales against the gyrations across all bond markets this week. Suddenly spooked by near-zero or even negative yields and a 50 percent rise in oil prices since January, investors have dumped German bonds in a manner not seen for decades.

The yield rose to a high of just under 80 basis points on Thursday from only five basis points in mid-April. Bund volatility soared to its highest since German reunification and bond prices were on course for the biggest fall since then.

The 10-year Treasury yield hit a five-month high above 2.30 percent, marking a rise of 50 basis points in only a month.

Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) has secured $17 billion from investors for its latest global private equity fund in just seven months, the biggest so-called first close of a buyout fund ever, according to people familiar with the matter.

The fundraising is continuing and Blackstone already has commitments totaling in excess of $17.5 billion, which is the fund's hard cap, or fundraising limit, the people said on Thursday, asking not to be identified because the fundraising process is confidential.

A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment.

Blackstone had said last month it expected the first close for the fund, dubbed Blackstone Capital Partners VII, to occur in the second quarter. "As you know, we have had a pattern of getting our hard caps, so we're optimistic about this one," Blackstone President Tony James said at the time.

Blackstone Capital Partners VII is the largest private equity fund to be raised since Apollo Global Management LLC's (APO.N) $18.4 billion flagship fund, which completed fundraising in January 2014.

Blackstone's previous buyout fund, Blackstone Capital Partners VI, raised $15.2 billion and reported a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 14 percent at the end of March.

The $21.7 billion Blackstone Capital Partners V fund, whose investment period ended in January 2011, reported a net IRR of 9 percent as of the end of March.

Blackstone Capital Partners VI attracted some of the world's largest private-equity investors, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, according to disclosures by the pension funds.

Unlike some of its peers that have funds with a specific geographic mandate, Blackstone's private equity funds are global in scope.

A rally in equity values has raised concerns among investors that private equity firms may overpay for companies. Blackstone had more than $20 billion in available capital to invest in private equity as of the end of March.

One of Blackstone's biggest success stories has been hotel company Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N), which went public last year. Blackstone said in July that Hilton’s share price at the time equated to a multiple of 2.8 times its original investment, which came from its private equity and real estate divisions. That implied a total gain of almost $12 billion, making it the largest private equity gain in history.

Blackstone's private equity fundraising comes on the heels of it raising its latest global real estate fund earlier this year, amassing $15.8 million in just a few months.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday posted a 45 percent rise in quarterly revenue, and shares of the Chinese e-commerce company jumped nearly 7 percent as investors cheered a smoother-than-expected transition to mobile transactions, which surpassed those from personal computers for the first time.

The company said Chief Operating Officer Daniel Zhang would become chief executive on May 10, replacing Jonathan Lu. Lu was CEO for two years, a low-key leader who was frequently eclipsed by outspoken founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma. Lu will remain on the board as vice chairman.

Alibaba's quarterly revenue jumped 45 percent to $2.81 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.77 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares jumped 6.9 percent to $85.54 at midday in the U.S. trading session.

"It was a very good quarter which is especially important considering there were a lot of expectations that the results would not come in strong," said Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities. "Sentiment is going to swing back to the favorable side."

Zhang takes the helm as the sprawling e-commerce company puts greater emphasis on reaching customers via mobile devices in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.

The company did not explain the reason for the change but Executive Chairman Ma said in a letter to staff he was pleased to see the reins going to a leader born in the 1970s. Zhang was born in 1972 while his predecessor was born in 1969.

Despite the change, Ma is seen as the driving force and the public face of the company. Analyst Tian Hou at Capital Research in Beijing said Zhang would be a thorough executive who executes well and believes in consensus. “He quietly gets things done,” she said.

Despite the strong fourth quarter, the incoming CEO could face slowing growth as saturation among online shoppers threatens to hobble expansion, along with stiff competition from domestic rivals Tencent Holding Ltd (0700.HK), Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) on mobile.

The total value of transactions made on Alibaba's platforms, known as gross merchandise volume (GMV), grew 40 percent to $97 billion in the quarter ended March 31. This was the lowest rate of growth in at least 11 quarters, despite sales on mobile devices growing 257 percent year-on-year to account for 51 percent of overall GMV.

Alibaba may also be facing e-commerce user saturation. The increase of annual active buyers, or customers who buy at least one product a year via Alibaba, was the smallest in 3-1/2 years, up 5 percent from the previous quarter to 350 million.

The group will continue investing in areas such as digital entertainment, cloud computing and mobile Internet, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told a conference call.

Zhang will also take on decelerating profit growth.

Alibaba's net income excluding extraordinary and one-off items grew 16 percent year-on-year, a far cry from 48 percent growth the previous year and triple-digit gains in the 12 months before that.

The Federal Reserve is sketching out plans to prevent an abrupt contraction in its massive balance sheet next year, when as much as $500 billion in bonds expire and risk disrupting markets and the U.S. economic recovery.

Though it ended a stimulative asset-purchase program last October, the Fed is still buying mortgage and Treasury bonds to replenish its $4.5-trillion portfolio as holdings mature. The central bank has said it will keep reinvesting until some time after it begins raising interest rates later this year.

Asked publicly and privately about the longer-term strategy, Fed policymakers say they are in no rush to shrink the portfolio, suggesting they will seek to avoid a "cliff" - a disruptive end to reinvestments that might come if bonds are simply allowed to run off through maturity or prepayment.

Economic analysis shows that shifting the end of reinvestments by several months in either direction would have "essentially no effect on the economic outlook," San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters last Friday.

"My view is this would happen organically," he added. But to avoid confusing investors with too many changes at once, he said, the Fed should give investors time to get used to rate increases before allowing the balance sheet to shrink. "You want enough separation in time just so that, once we get the (rate) normalization process going ... then this would be a decision that would be of second-order."

Six years of crisis-era purchases meant to boost economic growth quintupled the size of the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed predicts it will take until 2020 to shrink the portfolio back to normal.

The central bank can always sell bonds, but it said in September it will rely primarily on run-off to reduce holdings in a "gradual and predictable manner."

MANAGED DECLINE

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Reuters this year he wants to manage the rate of decline, a strategy that many bond investors expect. Simon Potter, the New York Fed official whose team manages the portfolio, said last month the central bank had an option to reduce the level of reinvestments gradually, rather than ending them all at once.

More than $200 billion of the Fed's Treasuries are set to expire in 2016, after very little matured this year. Among its mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are harder to evaluate due to prepayments and amortizations, analysts estimate up to $300 billion could run off the balance sheet next year. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer in February estimated the total value of the debt in the Fed's portfolio that will mature in 2016 at about $400 billion.

While some investors talk of a looming "balance sheet cliff," many Fed officials are more focused on when and how aggressively to raise interest rates, rather than on managing the reduction of holdings.

Simply allowing assets to roll off "is likely to be satisfactory," said Charles Evans, head of the Chicago Fed. "I think it's going to be at some point after we are comfortable in our liftoff strategy."

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told reporters last week that "there's been no determination about what the appropriate timing would be."

According to a March survey by the New York Fed, primary dealers expect the portfolio to shrink about six months after the Fed hikes rates, or sometime in the first quarter of 2016.

But policymakers could delay that for fear of slowing the economy given consumer confidence remains fragile and some Americans still struggle to get loans. Before that, rate hikes could also be delayed if the state of the economy called for it.

Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice president, predicted in a note to Potomac Research clients that the Fed would keep reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds until it hikes rates to 1 percent or more. That could be well into the second half of next year, according to the Fed's March forecasts.

Once the balance sheet starts to shrink, some analysts are predicting the Fed would keep reinvesting proceeds from half or even two-thirds of the roughly $40 billion in bonds expected to naturally run off each month, depending on the state of the economy.

"This means that the Fed will be a large and active participant in the bond market for the next few years," said Roberto Perli, a former Fed official who is now partner at research firm Cornerstone Macro.

Reliable demand from the central bank has helped bond markets stay near record highs, making it cheap for Americans to take on mortgages and other loans. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains low at 3.9 percent, according to Bankrate.

The Fed is by far the top holder of agency mortgage bonds, with about a third of the market at $1.7 trillion, said Andrew Szczurowski, vice president and fund manager at Eaton Vance.

"The Fed has handcuffed itself and must be very careful when trying to exit the market," he said, "because the last thing it wants is for spreads to blow out on MBS and mortgage rates to rise substantially."

Airbus (AIR.PA) has moved ahead of U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) in their race for aircraft orders thanks to a large Latin American win, setting the tone for what could be a fiercely competitive Paris Airshow next month.

The European planemaker won orders for 229 aircraft between January and April. After cancellations, net orders totaled 209, it said on Thursday.

The surge came after Colombia's Avianca confirmed an order for 100 Airbus jets in a $10 billion deal.

Also on Thursday, Boeing said it had won 153 orders this year, up to May 5, or 128 after adjusting for cancellations.

Boeing remained ahead on deliveries after handing 250 planes to customers in the first four months of 2015, compared with Airbus's total of 196.

Airbus deliveries of 7 A380 superjumbos so far this year included the 159th delivery since the double-decker entered service in 2007.

Last month's handover to Etihad Airways, coinciding with the tenth anniversary since the world's largest airliner first took flight, took A380 deliveries beyond the half-way point compared with the total of the twin-deck planes it has sold.

Airbus is studying whether to revamp the A380 to boost sales and says it is confident of replenishing the order pipeline even before that decision.

On Wednesday, the head of Qatar Airways said in Dubai he would not order more A380s without an "absolute rethink" by Airbus, adding that any revamp of the existing model would need to generate 10-15 percent fuel savings.

However, he praised the newer twin-engined A350-900 compared to Boeing's 787, which he said was only now coming out of early teething problems.

Qatar is the only A350 operator so far, with two in service. It operates the Boeing 787 and has ordered the larger 777X.

"I commend Airbus, they learned a lot from their mistakes ... When you compare the A350 to the 787, the former is head and shoulders above Boeing," Al Baker told a news conference.

But he issued a warning to Airbus about an emerging market for 400-seat planes, sandwiched between the largest model of A350, which seats 369 people, and the 544-seat A380.

"Unless Airbus goes a step higher than A350-1000, the (Boeing) 777-9X will be the backbone of a lot of airlines," he said. The 777-9X aims to carry 406 passengers from 2020.

Airbus has delivered one A350 this year as it ramps up production and says it is targeting 15 deliveries by end-year.

U.S. banks Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase expect to gain market share in equities this year, executives told Reuters, pointing to technology investment and new hires as financial-market trading picks up.

The comments echo a more optimistic stance from trading desks at global investment banks after a bumper quarter boosted by the European Central Bank's announcement of a bond-buying scheme to spur growth.

They also contrast with last year's more lackluster picture of stock trading, particularly in Europe, with tepid volume growth and increased regulatory scrutiny squeezing commissions and stoking fears of more cutbacks.

"We are not pulling back in equities, quite the opposite," said Tim Gately, Citi's head of equities for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), in an interview. "We continuously invest in technology, have made a number of senior hires and expect to grow our market and wallet share in 2015."

Citi, which said in the fourth quarter it would take actions to turn around its underperforming EMEA equities franchise, is making a push for a bigger share of spending from top clients and hedge funds, Gately added.

The bank has named Murray Roos as London-based global head of sales for equities and prime finance and Emmanuel Girod as global head of exotics trading.

Larger rival JPMorgan also expects to gain market share, according to Michael Wilson, head of EMEA equity sales at the bank, thanks to a dedicated hedge-fund sales team, better client targeting and new global equity products.

MORE TARGETED

At a time of tighter balance-sheet rules and cost cuts, banks in general are taking a more targeted approach to client lists when allocating resources.

"We are targeting market-share gains primarily via cross-selling, and so prime brokerage (specialist services for hedge funds) is a big opportunity ... We are also ready to be there for clients should rivals pull back," said JPMorgan's Wilson.

"We are investing and hiring within specialist sales, execution and technology."

Growing in cash equities is a multi-year objective for JPMorgan but the bank is already reaping some success from client segments including hedge funds.

Some have warned, however, that the optimism in equities may be more a case of market bullishness than a new dawn for highly automated, high-return but volume-dependent stock trading.

Some banking sources said they still expected some smaller players to cut back or exit equities given competitive pressures.

Yet first-quarter equities revenue grew at double-digit percentage rates for a number of U.S. banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, though Citi bucked the trend with a 1 percent decline.

The pick-up was also broadly felt in Europe, with Germany's Deutsche Bank unveiling a plan to invest in its small but growing equities trading division.

Trading conditions are set to stay positive, said Gately, thanks to near-zero yields in much of the bond market, which made equities more attractive. "The first quarter was not just a blip (for the industry)," he said.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held near a 15-year low last week in a sign that the labor market was strengthening despite moderate economic growth.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended May 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was well below the increase to 280,000 that economists had forecast.

Claims for the prior week were unrevised at 262,000, which was the lowest reading since April 2000. The sustained strength suggests March's sharp step down in job growth was likely an aberration, and could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates this year.

"This provides support that March's weakness was temporary and it underpins expectations that nonfarm hiring will rebound in April and continue to post healthy rates of job growth in the coming months," said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, hits its lowest level since May 2000.

The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher and prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose.

Claims, which remained below the key 300,000 threshold for a ninth straight week, are one of the timely indicators of the health of the U.S. economy. At current levels, they suggest positive momentum in the economy, even though growth stumbled badly last quarter.

Last week's claims have no bearing on Friday's employment report for April as they fall outside the survey period for the data.

However, the low trend in claims provides optimism that nonfarm payrolls rebounded in April, despite a report on Wednesday showing that private employers last month hired the fewest workers in more than a year.

SMALL BUSINESS HIRING UP

"This report leaves us fairly comfortable with our view that payrolls in April grew by around 200,000," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

A Reuters survey of economists forecast nonfarm payrolls increased 224,000 in April after gaining 126,000 in March, when hiring was held back by bad weather.

Expectations for a relatively strong employment report were also bolstered by a separate report showing small businesses increased hiring last month.

The National Federation of Independent Business said businesses added an average of 0.14 workers per firm last month.

Fifty-three percent of small businesses reported hiring or trying to hire, up 3 points from March, with the majority saying there were few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.

April's employment report could offer new clues on the strength of the economy's recovery after a mix of cold weather, a strong dollar, port disruptions and deep spending cuts by energy firms brought first-quarter growth to a crawl.

So far April data on automobile sales and manufacturing suggest moderate momentum in the economy at the start of the second quarter.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined to the lowest reading since November 2000, suggesting more long-term unemployed are getting jobs.

While the overall labor market is strengthening, lower oil prices are putting a strain on employment in a energy sector.

There were more than 20,000 job cuts in the sector last month, according to global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That brought the total job losses for the industry so far this year to 68,285.

Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, Baker Hughes (BHI.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N) have all announced multiple rounds of job cuts in recent months.

"The jobs that are most vulnerable are those in the field - engineers, oil rig operators, drill operators, refinery operators," said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Germany's Continental (CONG.DE) has raised its profit and sales guidance as auto demand in core European markets keeps growing while raw material prices and the weak euro provide momentum.

The recovery in western European car markets, where Continental earns about half its revenue, continued in April with car sales up 6.7 percent, according to LMC Automotive.

Continental said on Thursday sales could rise to more than 39 billion euros ($44.31 billion) this year, compared with a previous estimate of 38.5 billion, reflecting positive effects from the weak euro, stable rubber prices and falling oil prices.

The auto parts and tire maker's adjusted operating margin could again exceed 11 percent this year, finance chief Wolfgang Schaefer told Reuters, while still guiding for the margin to come in above 10.5 percent.

"We are growing faster than the markets," Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said. "We expect this positive development to continue."

Second-quarter business has got off to a "good start," Schaefer said, citing rebounding auto production in Europe.

Positive effects from foreign exchange developments could boost sales by 1 billion euros while favourable rubber and oil prices may add another 150 million euros, Continental said.

Continental shares were trading up 1.6 percent at 210 euros as of 1424 GMT (10.24 a.m. EDT).

Buoyed by 6.7 billion euros of liquidity reserves cash, Hanover-based Continental also hopes to benefit from acquisitions, especially in non-automotive segments, after concluding the purchase of U.S. rubber company Veyance Technologies this year.

"We are open to purchases," Schaefer said, though no major deals are planned in coming months.

"If we come across an attractive target, we will study it very closely," the CFO said, adding during a conference call that the company had looked at possible targets worth more than 2 billion euros.

Continental's upbeat remarks tie in with a broader trend among auto suppliers.

Leoni (LEOGn.DE), a provider of cables and cable systems to the automotive sector, said on Thursday first-quarter sales rose 9 percent to a record 1.109 billon euros, thanks to rising demand from the car and commercial vehicle sectors in Asia and the Americas.

Earnings before interest and taxes fell 30 percent due to investments affected by pre-production spending on numerous new wiring system projects, Leoni said.

Separately Rheinmetall said earnings before interest and tax rose by 20 percent at its automotive division that makes parts for pistons, engines and plain bearings, helping the group to deliver a forecast-beating operating profit in the first quarter.

MasterCard Inc (MA.N) has doubled the number of its cards to about 100 million in the Middle East and Africa in the past three years, where it has begun setting up partnerships with governments to provide access to its payments system.

That is still a small share of MasterCard's around 2.2 billion cards in use globally. But there is plenty of room for growth in a region where about 90 percent of transactions are still done in cash, compared with an average of 85 percent globally.

"This is the fastest growing region," Michael Miebach, president, Middle East and Africa for MasterCard worldwide, told Reuters. "We continue to expect growth above the global average."

In March, the world's second biggest debit and credit card company signed an agreement with the Egyptian government to issue digital identification cards with built-in payment devices to 54 million Egyptians, enabling them to pay for government fees, mobile phone bills, shop purchases and other goods and services.

The scheme links consumers' identification cards with an existing payment platform on mobile phones.

MasterCard has a pilot of a similar plan with the government of Nigeria, which also has a low rate of "financial inclusion."

"We see in the Middle East as well as Africa a fairly high cash dominance. If you go to Nigeria it is about 94 percent cash."

MasterCard and larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) get more than 60 percent of revenues from outside the United States. Less than a third of MasterCard's come from Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. PayPal, the payments arm of eBay (EBAY.O), is also active in the region.

MasterCard's first-quarter results, published last month, showed that purchase volumes in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa rose by 15.2 percent, faster than the 11.8 percent figure for worldwide volumes.

The size of transactions in the region increased by 20.9 percent, versus a 15 percent rise globally.

Within the Middle East and Africa, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were among the fastest growing markets, Miebach said. In the UAE, robust spending by Chinese helped to offset weakness in transactions volumes by Europeans and Russians as a result of softness in the euro and rouble against the U.S. dollar, he said.

Across the Middle East and Africa, business had been faster in debit cards than credit cards, with expansion also driven by popularity of prepaid cards, he said.

Last month, MasterCard did a deal with Premier Bank in Somalia to issue debit cards and install ATM machines in the country.

Miebach also said growth was strong in Sub-Saharan Africa, supported by buoyant economies and people switching from cash to cards.

Adidas (ADSGn.DE) shareholders took aim at the management of the German sportswear company on Thursday, not convinced a new strategy would be enough to challenge the dominance of rival Nike (NKE.N).

"Adidas is panting behind the competition. Adidas lost the race, at least in 2014," Gerhard Jaeger, spokesman for the SdK investor association, told the firm's annual shareholder meeting in the southern town of Fuerth.

Long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who faced calls to quit last year after Adidas was hit by falling golf sales and its heavy exposure to Russia, said the company was addressing problem areas and had made a good start to 2015.

But he added the firm had hired advisers Perella Weinberg Partners in the event of a more concerted campaign for change from an activist shareholder group, in a sign management is braced for more turmoil.

"It never feels good if you don't reach all of your goals, neither in sport, nor in business, nor in your personal life. But the key thing is to never give up," Hainer said.

"We have taken our learnings from 2014 and developed an exciting and promising strategy for the period up until 2020."

While Adidas shares tumbled 38 percent last year, they have rebounded this year, though helped by a buyback which some shareholders view as money that would be better invested.

FUTURE LEADERSHIP UNCERTAIN

Adidas reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as its struggling North America business showed signs of improvement after a big increase in marketing.

Hainer launched a five-year strategy in March to lift sales by almost half to above 22 billion euros ($25 billion), focused on speeding up the supply chain and success in the United States and the world's largest cities.

However, Marco Scherer, portfolio manager for Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management which holds a 1.7 percent stake in Adidas, said the strategy lacked credibility as the board was looking for a new CEO ahead of Hainer's contract expiring in 2017.

"What is missing from Adidas, is a clear direction ... Which management should lead this strategy ultimately to success? When will a decision come?" Scherer asked.

"Adidas responds to market conditions, but it seems to have forgotten how to set decisive trends itself," he added. "Where are the product innovations with which you want to take market share from Nike and Under Armour?"

Hainer, 14 years in the job and the longest-serving CEO of a German blue-chip, said the new strategy was developed by the whole top management team and was being implemented as a team.

Daniela Bergdolt, vice president of the Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fuer Wertpapierbesitz, Germany's largest association for private investors, welcomed the new direction but said it would take time to bear fruit.

She also called for Adidas to sell fitness brand Reebok, which it bought in 2006 but has failed to help Adidas grow its market share in the United States and is only now starting to recover after a long period of underperformance.

Hainer, who was the architect of the Reebok acquisition, said it would be wrong to sell the brand now it was growing again, especially given the booming popularity of fitness.

The global bond market rout slowed on Thursday as long-term borrowing costs retreated from their highest levels in more than five months, helping a mild recovery on Wall Street and for European stocks.

The absence of a deal between Greece and its creditors, however, was a drag on stocks and the euro.

Investors' stampede from stocks and bonds this week sent major European indexes to their lowest in two months and major U.S. and Japanese gauges to the weakest in a month.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's warning about high equity valuations on Wednesday added pressure to U.S. stocks ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report, which may support expectations of a possible Fed rate increase later this year.

"We had a real capitulation in markets this morning and there was no obvious catalyst," said Owen Callan, a senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Dublin. "We then had some bargain hunters coming in later in the day, but the moves have been driven by more speculative hedge funds."

A retreat in European bond yields from their session peaks caused the euro to decline from a 10-week high against the dollar.

Oil prices scaled back from their highest level so far in 2015 on perception of ample supply despite data that showed the first weekly drop in U.S. crude inventories since January.

A bounce in the dollar and elevated bond yields touched off a second day of selling in gold.

Bond markets were at the center of this week's rout, prompted by heavy supply and less pessimism about Europe, with German Bunds on track for their biggest weekly spike in yields in over a decade.

Italian and Spanish yields hit 2 percent for the first time this year, French yields topped 1 percent and U.S. Treasuries, the benchmark for borrowing costs globally, briefly broke 2.3 percent. [EUR/GVD] [US/]

Telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA), which is set to be bought by larger rival Nokia (NOK1V.HE), improved profit margins in the first quarter despite a marked sales slowdown in its biggest market, the United States.

Although it reported a net loss, higher software sales, a weak euro, and strong demand for its Internet routing products - which help telecom operators handle heavy broadband traffic from online video - helped the French firm post a better quarter than Nokia and mobile market leader Ericsson (ERICb.ST).

Both those competitors saw steep drops in their shares after missing profit targets, and Nokia's misstep prompted some Alcatel shareholders to say the takeover deal terms should be renegotiated.

Alcatel-Lucent Chief Executive Michel Combes dismissed the idea on Thursday, saying there was no need to change the deal since both companies were sticking to their annual targets.

"The strategic rationale of the deal does not depend on the performance of an isolated quarter," he said.

"There is no reason for any change."

Alexander Peterc, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the results showed a "significant divergence versus weak peers Nokia and Ericsson".

Alcatel shares were up 2.8 percent at 3.30 euro at 07:41 GMT, the biggest gainers on the on the French blue-chip CAC 40 index .FCHI. They had previously fallen nearly 30 percent since the acquisition by Nokia was announced in mid-April, hit by investor scepticism about the merits of the deal.

Nokia's acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent aims to position the company to better compete with Sweden's Ericsson as well as low-cost Chinese powerhouse Huawei [HWT.UL] by forging a strong number two in mobile with a more complete product line.

Alcatel-Lucent shareholders will get 0.55 shares in Nokia for every Alcatel-Lucent share, ending up with 33.5 percent of the enlarged group once the deal closes in mid-2016.

OUTPERFORMANCE

Alcatel-Lucent's first-quarter revenue rose 9 percent on a comparable basis to 3.24 billion euros ($3.68 billion), ahead of a company-provided consensus of 3.02 billion, while adjusted operating profit nearly doubled to 82 million euros compared with a consensus of 79 million.

The company posted a net loss of 72 million euros - almost flat to the 73 million loss a year before - but some measures of profitability improved because of cost cuts as well as the sale more higher margin products and software.

The gross margin improved to 34.6 percent in the quarter from 32.3 percent a year ago, and the operating margin was 2.5 percent versus 1.1 percent.

"The topline and gross margin beat are impressive, especially in the context of weak North America spending and after the very disappointing results of Nokia and Ericsson on that front," said Bernstein Research analyst Pierre Ferragu.

Alcatel-Lucent earns almost half its revenue in North America where it supplies mobile and broadband gear to Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N).

The group confirmed its aim to generate positive free cash flow by the end of the year, the central aim of Combes' turnaround. But it consumed 332 million euro more cash than it generated in the quarter, an improvement of 66 million.

Hedge fund mogul Daniel Loeb on Wednesday took aim at the "Oracle of Omaha," calling beloved billionaire Warren Buffett a hypocrite.

"I love how he criticizes hedge funds yet he really had the first hedge fund. He criticizes activists but he was the first activist," Loeb, who runs $17.5 billion hedge fund Third Point, said about Buffett who has been running conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway for 50 years.

Loeb, known in investment circles for his sharp tongue and top returns, made the comments at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, less than one week after Buffett hosted his company's shareholder meeting in Omaha.

Buffett, whose own strong record earned him his nickname, has in the past said that hedge funds could pose a threat to global markets and has a running bet with a New York-based hedge fund firm that hedge funds will underperform a low-cost index tracker over ten years. So far Buffett is winning the bet, he said at the weekend meeting in Omaha.

In Las Vegas, where Loeb was speaking to hundreds of hedge fund managers, investors, and lawyers in the Bellagio ballroom, the crowd was clearly on the fund manager's side, judging by the hearty applause his comments got.

"He has a lot of wisdom but there is a disconnect," Loeb said referring to the things Buffett says and what he actually does.

He quickly tried to walk back his comments by saying he took a "potshot" at the 84-year old investor and philanthropist who is widely seen as a hero by many other prominent hedge fund managers.

Morgan Stanley's commodities group has renewed a refined product storage deal with TransMontaigne Partners L.P. seven months early, as the Wall Street bank plans to sell its physical oil business.

In a statement on Wednesday, TransMontaigne said Morgan Stanley Capital Group extended its lease agreements for about 2.7 million barrels of refined product storage in Mississippi.

The move came about seven months before the contract was about to expire. The new agreement for the terminals located in Collins/Purvis, Mississippi will be effective Jan. 1, 2016, TransMontaingne said.

Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

The news comes as the bank continues to seek a buyer for its physical oil business after a deal to sell it to Russian oil company Rosneft fell apart last year.

Last week, it reshuffled the leadership of the physical oil trading business, naming Thomas Simpson and Fabrizio Zichichi as co-heads and replacing Michael Brennan.

Morgan Stanley will still act as a middleman for clients who want to trade physical commodities, but the bank no longer wants to own, operate or store products itself.

General Motors (GM.N) and its Chinese joint ventures sold 258,484 vehicles in China in April, down 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. automaker said on Thursday.

GM for the first time reported retail sales to customers rather than wholesale vehicle sales to dealers. Retail figures are generally viewed as a more accurate gauge of consumer demand.

Under the previous methodology, the automaker had reported an 8 percent year-on-year rise in March and a 1.3 percent increase in February.
