Teuvo Teravainen was left out of the final four games of Chicago's first-round series but returned to score the winner in a 4-3 victory over Minnesota in Game One of their second round matchup.

Teravainen broke a 3-3 tie with less than a minute left in the second after the Blackhawks had given up three goals in the period to allow the Wild to tie the game.

Chicago goaltender Corey Crawford stopped 30 of 33 shots.

After giving up three first-period goals, Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk settled down, stopping 31 of 35 shots, but was unable to do anything about the game-winner.

Brandon Saad, Patrick Kane and Marcus Kruger also scored for the Blackhawks while Jason Zucker, Zach Parise and Mikael Granlund tallied for Minnesota.

Game Two is on Sunday, again in Chicago.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao weighed in for what has been labeled the 'Fight of the Century' on Friday, promising to deliver on the massive hype and give fans the excitement they deserve.

What had been a subdued buildup to the most anticipated fight in decades exploded to life when Pacquiao and then Mayweather entered the MGM Grand Garden Arena to thumping hip hop music and deafening cheers from a seething crowd of 11,500, some of whom had waited three hours for a glimpse of the two boxers.

Pacquiao, 57-5-2 (38 knockouts) looking relaxed and confident, weighed in one pound lighter than the undefeated Mayweather 47-0 (26 KOs), tipping the scales at 145 pounds for Saturday's bout.

Their meeting is expected to be the biggest grossing prize fight of all-time.
"I have dedicated myself to the sport of boxing for the last 20 years and I am ready," declared Mayweather over a roar of boos and cheers.

Asked for a prediction about the fight, the 38-year-old American said, "I can't really say but I am ready to fight. It's an unbelievable turnout. I'm glad all the fans came out to here to support Manny and me."

Normally free and open to the public, the weigh-in broke from tradition, charging $10 to watch Mayweather and Pacquiao step onto the scales in a move designed to maintain crowd control.

All money raised through ticket sales went to charity, but many of the tickets found their way onto the resale market with some commanding $500.
A smiling Pacquiao, dressed in a bright red track suit, waved and raised his fists into the air as he slowly made his way to the stage, playfully interacting with the crowd.

In stark contrast, Mayweather was serious and focused, rarely looking up from under the brim of his 'Money Team' baseball cap to reveal a cheeky smirk.

Once the business of the official weigh-in was complete, the two welterweights moved to the front of the stage for the traditional stare down, the smaller Pacquiao looking up at Mayweather with a challenging smile while the stone-faced American stared straight-ahead unmoved.

"I have been fighting bigger guys like (Antonio) Margarito and (Oscar) De La Hoya," said the Filipino southpaw. "It doesn't matter to me. I feel tomorrow that the Lord is always with me and gives me strength.

"I know it's a great, great responsibility for me to give enjoyment to the fans.

"Tomorrow the fans deserve to have a great fight."

From air-conditioned corporate boardrooms to steamy public gymnasiums, Filipinos are counting down the hours to local boxing icon Manny Pacquiao's fight with undefeated American Floyd Mayweather Jr. in Las Vegas.

The world welterweight championship bout, which is being called the "fight of the century", will bring the country to a standstill on Sunday and mark a rare period of unity for the poor Southeast Asian nation.

"We also expect Maoist rebels and Muslim extremists to watch the Pacquaio-Mayweather fight," said Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Cabunoc, army spokesman, adding that wide television screens will be set up in all military camps, including conflict areas.

"Filipinos are all united behind our own hero. We are all rooting for Manny. We expect a very peaceful day, no crime, no fighting."

Pacquiao is a lieutenant colonel in the army reserve force.

A life-size Pacquiao 70-kg chocolate cake, which took two weeks to make, went on display on Saturday in Manila and slices will be given away after the bout.

Cinemas and restaurants have sold out tickets for the fight, and even prisoners at Saranggani jail will have the chance to watch the fight.

Taxi driver Manolo Garcia said he would stop for a few hours to listen to his radio.

"Win or lose, I am for Manny Pacquiao," he said. "I will pray for him, I will pray for his victory. God is on his side."

Local boxing analysts say the pressure is on Mayweather, who is seeking to preserve his unblemished professional record.

More than 86 million punches have been thrown at a virtual punching bag set up three weeks ago by the Philippines' largest broadcast network, ABS-CBN, to support eight-division champion Pacquiao.

Electricity distributor Manila Electric Company assured its customers there would be no power outage on fight day, but power generators on the southern island of Mindanao may not meet the surge in electricity demand.

"We want to avoid a revolt here, we have prepared for that," said Maria Cora Tito, tourism officer of General Santos City, showing Reuters a standby generator.

China's Xu Xin and Yang Ha-eun of South Korea have teamed up to become the first cross-border partnership to win the world mixed doubles table tennis championship for 61 years.

The pair beat Japan's Kasumi Ishikawa and Maharu Yoshimura 4-0 at the world championships on Friday, becoming the first mixed nationality winners of the title since Czechoslovakia's Ivan Andreadis and Hungarian Gizella Gervai at Wembley in 1954.

Xu played through a shoulder injury he sustained in his men's singles match earlier in the day but was quick to deflect Yang's assertion that his performance had been heroic.

"The injury definitely affected my play," the 25-year-old lefthander said. "I am glad that our partnership worked out well despite my injury.

"I am neither a hero, nor a warrior, but I made sure that I give my best. As long as that is the case, I think the outcome matters less compared to the process and efforts."

The world championships in Suzhou, China conclude on Sunday.

Fabian Castillo inspired FC Dallas to a crushing 4-1 win over Texan rivals Houston Dynamo in Major League Soccer on Friday.

The victory sent Dallas top of the Western Conference on 17 points, one more than the Vancouver Whitecaps, who play at Portland on Saturday.

A smart back-heel from Castillo set up Ryan Hollingshead for a superbly taken left-foot drive to give Dallas the lead in the ninth minute.

Castillo then burst down the right and slipped the ball perfectly into the path of David Texeira to confidently slot home 12 minutes later.

Giles Barnes pulled a goal back for Houston in the 32nd minute with a direct free-kick from the edge of the area but Mauro Diaz restored Dallas's two-goal cushion by blasting home from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.

Castillo completed the rout three minutes later with a clever finish with the outside of his foot.

In Utah, a woeful 72nd minute own goal from San Jose Earthquakes defender Victor Bernandez gave Real Salt Lake a 1-1 draw after Chris Wondolowski had put the visitors ahead.

Bernandez's attempted back pass beat his advancing goalkeeper David Bingham to ensure a share of the points.

On Saturday, Eastern Conference leaders the New England Revolution host the league's only unbeaten team, the New York Red Bulls.

Alex Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run on Friday to tie Willie Mays for fourth on Major League Baseball’s all-time list.

Rodriguez entered the game as a pinch-hitter and connected in the eighth inning at Boston’s Fenway Park on what was the game-winning blow in the New York Yankees’ 3-2 victory.

Rodriguez was greeted in the Yankees dugout with high-fives and hugs. The 39-year-old Rodriguez is playing his first season since being suspended for all of 2014 due to doping.

The home run triggered a $6 million bonus clause in A-Rod’s contract for career milestones, though there have been reports the Yankees may contest the payment.

Nikita Kucherov scored two minutes into the second period of overtime to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 2-1 road win over the Montreal Canadiens in Game One of their Eastern Conference semi-finals series on Friday.

Goaltender Carey Price made 33 saves for Montreal while Ben Bishop stopped 43 shots for the Lightning, who opened the scoring through Tyler Johnson early in the third period before Max Pacioretty replied in the closing minutes for the Canadiens.

The Lightning thought they ended it early in the first overtime when Kucherov took advantage of a bouncing puck to break in on Price but officials ruled out the goal, deeming that the winger had pushed the goalie into the net.

The Canadiens skated out to a strong start, controlling the play and hitting a pair of posts early in the first but were unable to get anything by Bishop.

Pacioretty was involved in two of Montreal's best chances in the second, both short-handed, but could not break through until 14:47 in the third with a goal that sent the game into overtime.

Johnson had earlier scored his NHL-leading seventh goal of the playoffs at 2:34 of the third period.

After a penalty to Montreal expired, defenseman Matt Carle fired a shot from the top of the left circle and Johnson, battling with Canadiens blue-liner Tom Gilbert in front of Price, deflected it just under the crossbar.

Game Two of the best-of-seven series is in Montreal on Sunday.

New Zealander Michael Campbell, who famously held off Tiger Woods to win the 2005 U.S. Open, has decided to retire from professional golf at the age of 46 because he has lost the motivation to play.

Campbell followed his major victory with a tie for fifth at the British Open and a tie for sixth at the PGA Championship in the same year.

Campbell won 15 tournaments over his career, most of which was spent on the European Tour, but his last title came when he won the World Match Play Championship at Wentworth a few months after his Pinehurst triumph.

"All of my friends who are the same age as me are still out there competing and doing well," he told New Zealand's Radio Sport on Saturday.

"It makes you wonder maybe I should go back and play but right now I have got no motivation to play. I have played golf for almost 40 years and that is a long time. I have played professionally for 20 years and that is a long time.

"I have no complaints to walk away from the game that has given me such a wonderful life but it's been a very hard decision."

Campbell said his recent divorce and struggles with injury had helped him decide to put competitive golf on hold and concentrate on his academies in Spain until he is 50 and qualifies to play senior tournaments.

"It gave me time to reflect on my career and I decided to put golf on the backburner right now and just focus on other things," Campbell added.

His major triumph a decade ago was only the second for a New Zealander after Bob Charles won the British Open at Lytham & St Annes in 1963.

"Obviously 10 years ago was something special for me and for the country and for golf itself," Campbell added. "I fulfilled one of my dreams to win a major and it was fantastic.

"But as everyone knows, it has been well documented, my career since then hasn't been great. But if I walk away from the game right now, I could be very proud of my achievements."

Canadian Brooke Henderson seized her second consecutive 36-hole lead after shooting a six-under 65 at the LPGA North Texas Shootout on Friday.

The 17-year-old, who is not a member of the LPGA and had to qualify to make the field, moved to eight-under for the tournament and leads South Korea's world number two Park In-bee and 54-year-old Juli Inkster by one shot.

Henderson also charged to the top of the leaderboard after two rounds at last week’s Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic before eventually finishing third.

"I hit it great all day and I was able to make a few putts," Henderson told reporters as she vies to become the first Monday qualifier since Laurel Kean in 2000 to win an LPGA event.

“I'm happy to be in the position that I am. I was in the same position last week and hopefully it will be a little better this week.”

Inkster is also in the running for the second straight week as she seeks her first win since 2006.

Four players are tied at six-under including Lexi Thompson heading into the weekend at the Los Colinas Country Club.

World number one Lydia Ko narrowly avoided missing her first LPGA cut after bouncing back from a four-over 75 in the opening round to fire a three-under 68.

At one-over for the tournament, she finished on the cut line.

Ko stole the spotlight from Henderson last week by winning the Swinging Skirts but will be hard pressed to do the same again this time around.

A victory for Henderson would see her join Ko and Thompson as the only players on the LPGA Tour to win before the age of 18.

A talented field with a slew of accustomed winners has been assembled for Saturday's Kentucky Derby, and with frontrunners as favorites in a crowded field the start could prove critical.

American Pharoah is the early favorite at 5-2 coming off four wins in a row, while stablemate Dortmund, also trained by three-time Derby winner Bob Baffert, is rated a 3-1 pick and coming to Churchill Downs with six wins in six races.

Third choice Carpe Diem (8-1), trained by Todd Pletcher, has won four of five career races and co-fourth pick Materiality (12-1) is 3-for-3, bidding to become the first horse to win this race for 3-year-olds without racing as a 2-year-old.

The favorites like to run out in front, which could make for a hectic start at Churchill Downs as 19 horses strive to get into favorable position by the first turn.

From Baffert’s perspective, the Derby will be won, and lost, in the moments after the gates open.

“Our horses are not going to be coming from out of the clouds,” said Baffert, whose Dortmund drew the eighth position, while American Pharoah starts from the 17th lane. “The break is going to be the key.”

Riding American Pharoah will be two-time Derby winner Victor Espinoza, who rode last year's champion, California Chrome.

“He rides with a lot of confidence and he’s been here at the big dance,” Baffert said.

Martin Garcia has ridden the unbeaten Dortmund for all his races.

“This is the first time that he’s going to ride a horse that actually has a really good chance to win (the Derby), so I’m sure he will be a little nervous,” Baffert said.

“He knows his horse. He’ll just put him in a nice spot."

Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Maktoum's Mubtaahij, listed at 20-1, won the UAE Derby by eight lengths and will attempt to win the 'Run for the Roses' without the benefit of a single U.S. prep race.

Mubtaahij, who has never been worse than second in his last five starts, would be the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby after racing the UAE Derby.

Mark Casse, trainer of Danzig Moon (30-1), hopes the frontrunners will burn themselves out.

“I would like to see a fast pace and have us be about 10 lengths behind,” Casse said. ”Hopefully the pace comes apart at the seams and we can pick them up.”

World number one Rory McIlroy fought back from two holes down with two to play to beat Billy Horschel at the WGC-Match Play Championship on Friday, while Masters champion Jordan Spieth was knocked out after losing to Lee Westwood.

McIlroy buried a 24-footer for birdie to win the 17th then birdied the last to square the match with FedEx Cup champion Horschel, who faltered with a bogey at the second extra hole to send his opponent into the last 16.

McIlroy, who will play Japan's Hideki Matsuyama in the next round, said he picked the perfect time to hit his best putt of the day on 17.

"Obviously you make the putt or you are going home,” he said. "Hit the best putt that I hit all day, thankfully.

"When I got him up to 18, I knew just try and keep the pressure on him and somehow I was able to turn it around.”

England’s Westwood beat Spieth 2 up, fighting back from an early deficit and ramming home an important 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th to wrestle a lead he would not relinquish.

After missing an 11-foot birdie putt on the first and then making bogey on the second hole, Westwood was two down out of the blocks.

A Spieth bogey on six and a 13-foot birdie putt for Westwood on the ninth squared the match at the turn.

Westwood took the lead a hole later when the 21-year-old American failed to get up and down from just off the green.

After the 11th hole they were square again when Spieth made a birdie from 14 feet.

The pair then traded clutch pars for three holes.

Spieth appeared in trouble when he missed the 15th green but chipped in for birdie. Westwood did not flinch and made his six-foot birdie putt to match.

A hole later it was Westwood with the heroics.

After sending a greenside bunker shot over the green and leaving his next chip short in the rough, the Englishman chipped in for par and Spieth missed his 14-foot birdie chance to stay tied.

Westwood birdie the penultimate hole, leaving Spieth needing to win the 18th, which he was unable to do.

Westwood will play compatriot Danny Willett next up.

Hunter Mahan, the 2012 champion and 2013 runner-up, advanced to the final 16 for the fifth straight year with a crushing 5&4 win over fellow American Matt Kuchar.

Mahan has destroyed his group, winning 7&6 over Stephen Gallacher and 5&3 over Ben Martin over the opening two days.

He will face Australian John Senden, who finished off his group play 3-0 with a 1 up win over Brendon Todd, knocking out world number three Henrik Stenson and former FedEx Cup champion Bill Haas in the process.

In other last 16 ties, Marc Leishman takes on Gary Woodland, Branden Grace faces Tommy Fleetwood, Jim Furky is up against JB Holmes, Louis Oosthuizen faces Rickie Fowler and Charl Schwartzel plays Paul Casey.

Sin City was gearing up for a knockout weekend as A-listers and high-rollers flooded into the gambling resort on Friday for what has been labeled the 'Fight of the Century'.

Only the fabulously rich and very famous hold golden tickets to the heavily secured 16,800 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena for Saturday night's showdown between undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao that is expected to be the biggest-grossing fight of all-time.

The place to be seen this weekend, celebrities, business tycoons and entertainment moguls have been calling in favors in an effort to score one of the coveted ringside seats that are demanding up to $350,000 on resale site StubHub.

Fewer than 1,000 tickets were offered to the public, and those vanished in seconds. The remainder were divided among the two fighters' promotion companies and MGM, which will make seats available to their best customers.

If you don't have at least a $250,000 line of credit, do not even ask.

Fight promoters are preparing for an Oscars' worthy red carpet with a who's who of Hollywood, including Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck sitting ringside, according to a list obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

World number one golfer Rory McIlroy and Masters champion Jordan Spieth, who are playing in the elite WGC-Cadillac Match Play in San Francisco, will both be seated on the flooring, flying to Las Vegas in a private jet Saturday after wrapping up their round.

"Where did I get my ticket? I don't know. I do know, but I'm not sure I want to say," McIlroy told reporters. "Definitely don't want to tell you how much I paid for it."
With thousands of fight fans descending on Las Vegas just to be close to the buzz, casinos up-and-down the Strip are cashing in, with sky-high room rates and VIP parties and events.

Many hotels are charging $1,000 a night while lodging at the fight headquarters the MGM Grand will set you back $1,600 to $1,750 a night.

Across the street at the Excalibur, rooms that were going for $38 a night on Tuesday will cost over $500 on Friday and Saturday.

But the fight will not be the exclusive haunt of the ultra-wealthy and connected.

Some determined fight fans like Scott Buckleton, a 35-year-old Englishman who lives in Pennsylvania, found a way to crash the party, paying $10,800 for a pair of tickets on StubHub and shelling out another $1,500 for a room for five days at the Tropicana Hotel.

“We said many years ago that if this fight ever happened we would go anywhere and do anything to be there," Buckleton told Reuters. "It is a once-in-a-lifetime boxing event.

“We booked flights and accommodation before we had any sense of what the tickets would be like.”

Gamblers will also be contributing to the local economy with experts predicting the fight will be one of Nevada's most heavily bet-upon sporting events.

Jay Rood, vice president of race and sports book at MGM Resorts, expects the Mayweather-Pacquiao wager total to be between $60 and $80 million.

The biggest bet taken so far by MGM Resorts has been $500,000 on Pacquiao, but Rood expects there will be several million dollar plus bets placed with the high-rollers set to invade the Strip on Friday.

El Kabeir, who ran third in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in his last race, has been scratched from Saturday's Kentucky Derby after his morning gallop at Churchill Downs was canceled due to concern over his foot.

The scratch makes the Kentucky Derby, the opening event of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown for 3-year-olds, a 19-horse race.

American Pharoah, at 5-2, and Dortmund, at 3-1, both trained by Bob Baffert, were rated the early favorites for the mile and a quarter run.

Zayat Stables' El Kabeir, a 30-1 shot, was to have started from the seventh position. Post position number one will now be left open, and all others will slide down with no gaps.

Trainer John Terranova expressed his concern after scrubbing the morning gallop.

“We’re a wait-and-see. He just has a tender spot in the inside quarter of his left front foot. We’re working on it. It could be a simple bruise. It could be an abscess forming there,” Terranova said. “We’re working on it.

“We’ll see how he is later today and tomorrow morning,” he said.

El Kabeir was a prominent competitor during the winter and spring at New York's Aqueduct track.

Palestine will seek Israel's expulsion from world soccer's governing body at this month's FIFA Congress, FA president Jibril Rajoub has told Reuters.

Last year Rajoub agreed to drop a resolution urging delegates to take sanctions against Israel at FIFA's Congress in Sao Paulo but he said on Friday he would press ahead with the same proposal in Zurich on May 29.

He added he "would not make the concessions" he made when withdrawing the proposal a year ago because nothing had improved in the way Israel "were persecuting Palestine footballers, athletes and the movement of sporting equipment".

"Enough is enough," Rajoub said after attending the signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) aimed at building more co-operation between the two organizations.

"Last year we dropped the resolution when Europe got involved and the Israelis promised to co-operate in improving the situation," said the Palestine FA chief in the Bahrain capital Manama.

"But one year on it is still behaving like the neighborhood bully, or worse.

"There is now a feeling Europe cannot sit back and ignore what Israel is doing any longer. Israel has humiliated all of those trying to help the situation and nothing has changed.

"A year ago I agreed to drop the proposal, I will not do that again. The aggression towards our sportsmen and women in the West Bank and Gaza continues. It is hostile and racist and the time has come to take action."

Palestine has already tabled its motion and it is on the Congress agenda.

RE-ELECTION BID

FIFA president Sepp Blatter has tried to resolve the crisis between the two neighbors. His best efforts have failed but he will not want the disharmony to blot Congress where he will seek re-election for a fifth term as president.

Asked if Blatter would go to Israel before May 29 to attempt to ease the situation, a FIFA spokesman told Reuters: "It is a possibility, not a certainty, but it is a problem the president would like to see resolved".

Rajoub met Blatter in Manama during this week's AFC Congress and is keen for the Swiss to seek a solution. However, he is not optimistic and is in no mood to back down again.

"This is the third year in a row this has come up, first in Mauritius, then Brazil and now again," he explained.

"I don't think anything will change in the next few weeks. We are close to crossing the bridge and no-one can stop us having the proposal on the agenda even if some people would rather it was not."

It would need a three-quarter majority of FIFA's 209 members for Palestine's proposal to succeed and Rajoub believes it will happen.

"Don't think just because Israel is in Europe that Europe will support Israel any longer," he said, referring to the country's footballing ties.

"I think (UEFA president) Michel Platini, who has backed Israel in the past, has had enough. He sent us sports equipment which was held by Israel for 16 months and we had to pay $32,000 to get it.

"Europe has had enough, Africa, Asia and us. The time has come," added Rajoub.

Manny Pacquiao weighed in one pound lighter than American Floyd Mayweather after the Filipino was welcomed by deafening cheers from his supporters on the eve of Saturday's hotly anticipated welterweight showdown.

Pacquiao, 57-5-2 (38 knockouts), tipped the scales at 145 pounds in front of a massive crowd at the MGM Grand Garden Arena where fans purchased $10 tickets to gain entry.

Undefeated Mayweather, 47-0 (26 KOs), a 2-1 favorite for what has been billed as the 'Fight of the Century', was weighed second, hitting the scales at 146 pounds for the scheduled 12-round megabout.

The showdown between the two best boxers of their generation has been more than five years in the making and is expected to be the biggest-grossing prize fight of all time.

A congressional bill that would eliminate most wagering on horseracing, introduced to encourage the sport to end alleged widespread doping and cheating, was labeled on Friday by an industry leader as "a shameless publicity stunt."

The legislation, authored by Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, and Representative Joe Pitts, a Republican from Pennsylvania, would repeal the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 that permits "off-track" and online wagering.

"This bill is a shameless publicity stunt that mischaracterizes one of the nation’s most highly regulated sports," said National Thoroughbred Racing Association President and CEO Alex Waldrop.

Waldrop said the legislation, introduced Thursday, two days before America's most celebrated race, the Kentucky Derby, ignores industry efforts to clean up the game.

About 90 percent of the $11 billion wagered on horseracing comes from either online or interstate "off-track" simulcasting, Udall and Pitts said.

Pitts said in a statement the industry is "plagued by too many unscrupulous trainers, owners, veterinarians and other race track officials who race sickened or injured horses, pumping them full of...drugs in order to try to win at all costs."

The bill was also intended to inspire the elimination of alleged race-fixing, Pitts said.

"We are disappointed that they have decided to take this approach," said James Gagliano, president of The Jockey Club. "The Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 is the lifeblood of the industry, and we strongly oppose any effort to repeal it."

The horse racing industry is looking to adopt the National Uniform Medication Program, a get-tough system designed to target individuals with multiple medication violations.

"Despite years of promises of reform, horseracing groups have been unable to come together to develop uniform rules that protect both horses and the integrity of the sport," Pitts said.

He said that since 2008 more than 7,000 horses have died on U.S. racetracks.

"It's past time to put measures in place that protect racehorses from abuse at the track," he said.

Gamblers have flocked in huge numbers to Sin City for Saturday's welterweight showdown between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao which experts believe will be one of Nevada's most heavily bet-upon sporting events.

The National Football League's showpiece Super Bowl accounts for the top 20 events of all time for sports betting in the "Silver State" but industry insider Jay Kornegay predicts that the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout could break that trend.

"The biggest sporting events for betting have always been the Super Bowl, based on handle," Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook, told Reuters.

"But this fight has a chance to break that trend and possibly even be in the top 10 events of all time.

"This is the biggest fight I have ever been a part of, and I've been in this industry for almost 30 years. The amount of betting attention this fight has seen prior to the fight weekend is unprecedented."

Jay Rood, vice president of race and sports book at MGM Resorts, expects the Mayweather-Pacquiao wager total to be between $60 and $80 million.

"It's really going to be concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip corridor, the further you get away from the Strip, the less financial impact the fight is going to have to the sports books around the state," Rood told Reuters.

"But there are plenty of people coming to town with some rather large bank rolls so I think it's going to be solidly north of $60 million."

Neither Kornegay nor Rood expect the fight to eclipse the record $119 million bet in Nevada for the 2014 Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos, but they agree that Saturday's bout could come close.

"Most of the Super Bowls have exceeded at least $80 million, dating back probably to 1995, but this fight has got the potential to crack that 20-year reign," said Rood.

BIG BETS

The early wagers favor Pacquiao, who is a 2-1 underdog, while the big spenders tip Mayweather.

"I would say 87 percent of the tickets have been on Pacquiao with almost all of the larger wagers, meaning five figures and above, on Mayweather," said Kornegay. "We expect those betting patterns to continue."

MGM Resorts has Mayweather listed as a minus-200 favorite, so a $200 bet would win $100, while Pacquiao is a plus-170 underdog, meaning that a bet of $100 would win $170.

The biggest bet taken so far by MGM Resorts has been $500,000 on Manny Pacquiao, but Rood expects that to be surpassed over the next 24 hours.

"You normally take those large wagers on Friday or Saturday of the fight, and I'm hopeful that we are going to get some seven-figure wagers," Rood said.

"We have had some inquiry on placing a seven-figure wager on Mayweather, actually several of them, but usually you get about 25 percent of the inquires actually show up at the counter and place the cash."

The fight has also led to a few unusual proposition bets being created.

"Most of Mayweather's recent fights have ended in a decision so we said if it's going to go to a decision most likely, let's have a prop bet on that," Rood explained. "So we have a judges' scorecard over-under.

"We put the judges' accumulative score and you bet whether you think it's going to be over or under a certain point. And we established Mayweather's point to be 347.5 and Pacquiao to be 336.5."

There are also 'pick the knockout round' bets.

"We have the five packets," said Rood. "Floyd by a knockout or decision, Manny by a knockout or decision and then the draw."

Roger Federer was given a fright before reaching the semi-final of the inaugural Istanbul Open on Friday, eventually beating Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver 7-6(3) 6-7(5) 6-3.

The Swiss world number two, the top draw at the new claycourt event, needed two hours 28 minutes to set up a semi-final against eighth seed Diego Schwartzman.

Argentine Schwartzman won only seven points in a dreadful opening set against Colombia's fourth seed Santiago Giraldo but triumphed 0-6 6-2 6-2.

Second seeded Bulgarian Grigor Dmitrov eased into the semis with a straightforward defeat of Croatian Ivan Dodig and will face Pablo Cuevas on Saturday.

Organisers will no doubt be hoping for a Federer/Dimitrov showdown on Sunday as the tournament tries to establish itself on the ATP Tour.

Federer, who was photographed on the ATP website visiting some of the city's many attractions, is clearly a fan, even if he was not completely happy with his form.

"They were perfect playing conditions today," the 17-times grand slam champion said. "Almost no wind, beautiful sunshine; not to hot, not too cold.

"Just because it's nice weather doesn't mean you're going to play nice. I wish it was like that, but it's not as simple as that. It was a good fight today."

International Star has been scratched from Saturday's Kentucky Derby over concerns over a possible abscess in his left front foot, owner Ken Ramsey said.

Without International Star, rated a 20-1 shot in the early betting line, the field is down to 18 horses at Churchill Downs for the first race of the Triple Crown series for 3-year-olds.

Ramsey said the state veterinarian did not like the way the horse jogged down the shedrow on Saturday morning at

"Our blacksmith took the left-front shoe off and there was definitely some heat on the inside quarter of the left-front foot," the horse owner said.

"Something’s brewing in there, probably an abscess. There’s nothing major wrong with the horse whatsoever. We think we’ll probably have him ready to come back for the Preakness but time will tell."

International Star, winner of three in a row including the Louisiana Derby in his last start, was slated to go off from the 12th post position. Post position number one will be left open, and all other horses will slide down with no gaps.

“It’s a devastating blow to come this far. I thought I had a decent shot at winning the race," said Ramsey.

Roger Federer stood one match away from his first claycourt title in three years after reaching the final of the inaugural Istanbul Open with a 2-6 6-2 7-5 win over Argentine eighth seed Diego Schwartzman on Saturday.

The top seed fired six aces as he advanced to his fourth ATP final of the year and the 128th of his career.

The Turkish crowd backed world number two Federer throughout the match, even when he was handed a code violation for angrily hitting the ball away as he lost the first set. 

"I had a slow start maybe, yesterday was tough so it took me a little bit of time," said Federer, who also needed three sets to reach the semi-final.

"I am still here, I am hitting the ball well. I am playing against opponents who have nothing to lose. As long as I find a way to win it's great."

Federer will face third seed Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the final on Sunday. Cuevas beat Bulgarian second seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-2 6-4 in the second semi-final.

Federer last won on clay in 2012 at the Madrid Masters when the tournament was played on a slick blue clay surface.

Silvio Berlusconi will keep control of his AC Milan soccer club but could sell a minority stake, his holding company said on Saturday, following talks between the former Italian prime minister and Thai businessman Bee Taechaubol.

Berlusconi met Bee for the second time this week but a statement from Fininvest dismissed growing media speculation in recent months that he could sell a majority stake in Milan, one of Italy's most glamorous clubs.

"The proposed collaboration, which remains to be defined in many points, foresees the acquisition of a minority stake by a group of investors and that control of the club remains solidly in the hands of President Silvio Berlusconi and Fininvest," the statement read.

Italian media reports said Bee was offering 500 million euros ($560 million) for a 51 percent stake in Milan, aiming to join a series of other foreign tycoons who have bought some of the most prestigious European soccer clubs in recent years.

AC Milan, seven times European champions, has been a central part of Berlusconi's media and political empire for three decades.

But the club has lost some of its shine in recent years. It won the most recent of its 18 Serie A championships in 2011, racked up debts of 250 million euros and made a loss of 91 million euros last year.

"My main concern is to give Milan fans the guarantee that the new season will ensure a future that matches the heights of the glorious past," Berlusconi told reporters after meeting with Bee at a Milan hotel. The two men also met at Berlusconi's sumptuous villa on Wednesday.

The Fininvest statement said discussion topics included raising the value of the AC Milan brand in Asia.

Neither Berlusconi nor Bee offered any indication of how long it could take to wrap up a deal.

"We are now going to work on some minor details and we'll take a little bit more time," said Bee, executive director of private equity group Thai Prime Company Limited.

As well as Milan, speculation has grown that Berlusconi may sell his Mediaset television group's pay TV operation, built around broadcast rights to Champions League soccer matches.

Mediaset, Italy's biggest commercial broadcaster, was a key element in Berlusconi's 20-year-long domination of Italian politics, while his image as a winner was burnished by the on-field success of his soccer club.

Since being forced from office as prime minister at the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011 and being convicted for tax fraud in 2013, Berlusconi's political fortunes have faded.

He has increasingly withdrawn from frontline politics and struggled to keep his fractious center-right party Forza Italia united as younger rivals have emerged to challenge his leadership.

 Alex Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run on Friday to tie Willie Mays for fourth on Major League Baseball's all-time list.

Rodriguez entered the game as a pinch-hitter and connected in the eighth inning at Boston's Fenway Park on what was the game-winning blow in the New York Yankees' 3-2 victory.

Nicknamed "A-Rod", the slugger was greeted in the Yankees dugout with high-fives and hugs, and showered with champagne in the locker room.

"That's the first champagne bath I've had in early May in my career." Rodriguez told reporters. "Any time that you're sandwiched between Willie Mays and Babe Ruth is pretty special. "I am thankful to the Yankees and Major League Baseball for allowing me to play."

The 39-year-old Rodriguez is playing his first season since being suspended for all of 2014 due to a doping violation and has belted six home runs so far in his comeback campaign.

The blast triggered a $6 million bonus clause in A-Rod's contract for career milestones, though there have been reports the Yankees may contest the payment.

Despite the controversy surrounding the slugger, Mays released a statement congratulating Rodriguez. "Congratulations to Alex Rodriguez on his 660th home run," Mays said. "Milestones in baseball are meant to be broken and I wish him continued success throughout his career."

Former Yankee Ruth is third on the all-time list with 714 homers, behind Hank Aaron (755) and Barry Bonds (762).

Teuvo Teravainen was left out of the final four games of Chicago's first-round series but returned to score the winner in a 4-3 victory over Minnesota in Game One of their second round matchup.

Teravainen broke a 3-3 tie with less than a minute left in the second after the Blackhawks had given up three goals in the period to allow the Wild to tie the game.

Chicago goaltender Corey Crawford stopped 30 of 33 shots.

After giving up three first-period goals, Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk settled down, stopping 31 of 35 shots, but was unable to do anything about the game-winner.

Brandon Saad, Patrick Kane and Marcus Kruger also scored for the Blackhawks while Jason Zucker, Zach Parise and Mikael Granlund tallied for Minnesota.

Game Two is on Sunday, again in Chicago.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao weighed in for what has been labeled the 'Fight of the Century' on Friday, promising to deliver on the massive hype and give fans the excitement they deserve.

What had been a subdued buildup to the most anticipated fight in decades exploded to life when Pacquiao and then Mayweather entered the MGM Grand Garden Arena to thumping hip hop music and deafening cheers from a seething crowd of 11,500, some of whom had waited three hours for a glimpse of the two boxers.

Pacquiao, 57-5-2 (38 knockouts) looking relaxed and confident, weighed in one pound lighter than the undefeated Mayweather 47-0 (26 KOs), tipping the scales at 145 pounds for Saturday's bout.

Their meeting is expected to be the biggest grossing prize fight of all-time.
"I have dedicated myself to the sport of boxing for the last 20 years and I am ready," declared Mayweather over a roar of boos and cheers.

Asked for a prediction about the fight, the 38-year-old American said, "I can't really say but I am ready to fight. It's an unbelievable turnout. I'm glad all the fans came out to here to support Manny and me."

Normally free and open to the public, the weigh-in broke from tradition, charging $10 to watch Mayweather and Pacquiao step onto the scales in a move designed to maintain crowd control.

All money raised through ticket sales went to charity, but many of the tickets found their way onto the resale market with some commanding $500.
A smiling Pacquiao, dressed in a bright red track suit, waved and raised his fists into the air as he slowly made his way to the stage, playfully interacting with the crowd.

In stark contrast, Mayweather was serious and focused, rarely looking up from under the brim of his 'Money Team' baseball cap to reveal a cheeky smirk.

Once the business of the official weigh-in was complete, the two welterweights moved to the front of the stage for the traditional stare down, the smaller Pacquiao looking up at Mayweather with a challenging smile while the stone-faced American stared straight-ahead unmoved.

"I have been fighting bigger guys like (Antonio) Margarito and (Oscar) De La Hoya," said the Filipino southpaw. "It doesn't matter to me. I feel tomorrow that the Lord is always with me and gives me strength.

"I know it's a great, great responsibility for me to give enjoyment to the fans.

"Tomorrow the fans deserve to have a great fight."

From air-conditioned corporate boardrooms to steamy public gymnasiums, Filipinos are counting down the hours to local boxing icon Manny Pacquiao's fight with undefeated American Floyd Mayweather Jr. in Las Vegas.

The world welterweight championship bout, which is being called the "fight of the century", will bring the country to a standstill on Sunday and mark a rare period of unity for the poor Southeast Asian nation.

"We also expect Maoist rebels and Muslim extremists to watch the Pacquaio-Mayweather fight," said Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Cabunoc, army spokesman, adding that wide television screens will be set up in all military camps, including conflict areas.

"Filipinos are all united behind our own hero. We are all rooting for Manny. We expect a very peaceful day, no crime, no fighting."

Pacquiao is a lieutenant colonel in the army reserve force.

A life-size Pacquiao 70-kg chocolate cake, which took two weeks to make, went on display on Saturday in Manila and slices will be given away after the bout.

Cinemas and restaurants have sold out tickets for the fight, and even prisoners at Saranggani jail will have the chance to watch the fight.

Taxi driver Manolo Garcia said he would stop for a few hours to listen to his radio.

"Win or lose, I am for Manny Pacquiao," he said. "I will pray for him, I will pray for his victory. God is on his side."

Local boxing analysts say the pressure is on Mayweather, who is seeking to preserve his unblemished professional record.

More than 86 million punches have been thrown at a virtual punching bag set up three weeks ago by the Philippines' largest broadcast network, ABS-CBN, to support eight-division champion Pacquiao.

Electricity distributor Manila Electric Company assured its customers there would be no power outage on fight day, but power generators on the southern island of Mindanao may not meet the surge in electricity demand.

"We want to avoid a revolt here, we have prepared for that," said Maria Cora Tito, tourism officer of General Santos City, showing Reuters a standby generator.

China's Xu Xin and Yang Ha-eun of South Korea have teamed up to become the first cross-border partnership to win the world mixed doubles table tennis championship for 61 years.

The pair beat Japan's Kasumi Ishikawa and Maharu Yoshimura 4-0 at the world championships on Friday, becoming the first mixed nationality winners of the title since Czechoslovakia's Ivan Andreadis and Hungarian Gizella Gervai at Wembley in 1954.

Xu played through a shoulder injury he sustained in his men's singles match earlier in the day but was quick to deflect Yang's assertion that his performance had been heroic.

"The injury definitely affected my play," the 25-year-old lefthander said. "I am glad that our partnership worked out well despite my injury.

"I am neither a hero, nor a warrior, but I made sure that I give my best. As long as that is the case, I think the outcome matters less compared to the process and efforts."

The world championships in Suzhou, China conclude on Sunday.

Fabian Castillo inspired FC Dallas to a crushing 4-1 win over Texan rivals Houston Dynamo in Major League Soccer on Friday.

The victory sent Dallas top of the Western Conference on 17 points, one more than the Vancouver Whitecaps, who play at Portland on Saturday.

A smart back-heel from Castillo set up Ryan Hollingshead for a superbly taken left-foot drive to give Dallas the lead in the ninth minute.

Castillo then burst down the right and slipped the ball perfectly into the path of David Texeira to confidently slot home 12 minutes later.

Giles Barnes pulled a goal back for Houston in the 32nd minute with a direct free-kick from the edge of the area but Mauro Diaz restored Dallas's two-goal cushion by blasting home from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.

Castillo completed the rout three minutes later with a clever finish with the outside of his foot.

In Utah, a woeful 72nd minute own goal from San Jose Earthquakes defender Victor Bernandez gave Real Salt Lake a 1-1 draw after Chris Wondolowski had put the visitors ahead.

Bernandez's attempted back pass beat his advancing goalkeeper David Bingham to ensure a share of the points.

On Saturday, Eastern Conference leaders the New England Revolution host the league's only unbeaten team, the New York Red Bulls.

Nikita Kucherov scored two minutes into the second period of overtime to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a 2-1 road win over the Montreal Canadiens in Game One of their Eastern Conference semi-finals series on Friday.

Goaltender Carey Price made 33 saves for Montreal while Ben Bishop stopped 43 shots for the Lightning, who opened the scoring through Tyler Johnson early in the third period before Max Pacioretty replied in the closing minutes for the Canadiens.

The Lightning thought they ended it early in the first overtime when Kucherov took advantage of a bouncing puck to break in on Price but officials ruled out the goal, deeming that the winger had pushed the goalie into the net.

The Canadiens skated out to a strong start, controlling the play and hitting a pair of posts early in the first but were unable to get anything by Bishop.

Pacioretty was involved in two of Montreal's best chances in the second, both short-handed, but could not break through until 14:47 in the third with a goal that sent the game into overtime.

Johnson had earlier scored his NHL-leading seventh goal of the playoffs at 2:34 of the third period.

After a penalty to Montreal expired, defenseman Matt Carle fired a shot from the top of the left circle and Johnson, battling with Canadiens blue-liner Tom Gilbert in front of Price, deflected it just under the crossbar.

Game Two of the best-of-seven series is in Montreal on Sunday.

New Zealander Michael Campbell, who famously held off Tiger Woods to win the 2005 U.S. Open, has decided to retire from professional golf at the age of 46 because he has lost the motivation to play.

Campbell followed his major victory with a tie for fifth at the British Open and a tie for sixth at the PGA Championship in the same year.

Campbell won 15 tournaments over his career, most of which was spent on the European Tour, but his last title came when he won the World Match Play Championship at Wentworth a few months after his Pinehurst triumph.

"All of my friends who are the same age as me are still out there competing and doing well," he told New Zealand's Radio Sport on Saturday.

"It makes you wonder maybe I should go back and play but right now I have got no motivation to play. I have played golf for almost 40 years and that is a long time. I have played professionally for 20 years and that is a long time.

"I have no complaints to walk away from the game that has given me such a wonderful life but it's been a very hard decision."

Campbell said his recent divorce and struggles with injury had helped him decide to put competitive golf on hold and concentrate on his academies in Spain until he is 50 and qualifies to play senior tournaments.

"It gave me time to reflect on my career and I decided to put golf on the backburner right now and just focus on other things," Campbell added.

His major triumph a decade ago was only the second for a New Zealander after Bob Charles won the British Open at Lytham & St Annes in 1963.

"Obviously 10 years ago was something special for me and for the country and for golf itself," Campbell added. "I fulfilled one of my dreams to win a major and it was fantastic.

"But as everyone knows, it has been well documented, my career since then hasn't been great. But if I walk away from the game right now, I could be very proud of my achievements."

Canadian Brooke Henderson seized her second consecutive 36-hole lead after shooting a six-under 65 at the LPGA North Texas Shootout on Friday.

The 17-year-old, who is not a member of the LPGA and had to qualify to make the field, moved to eight-under for the tournament and leads South Korea's world number two Park In-bee and 54-year-old Juli Inkster by one shot.

Henderson also charged to the top of the leaderboard after two rounds at last week’s Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic before eventually finishing third.

"I hit it great all day and I was able to make a few putts," Henderson told reporters as she vies to become the first Monday qualifier since Laurel Kean in 2000 to win an LPGA event.

“I'm happy to be in the position that I am. I was in the same position last week and hopefully it will be a little better this week.”

Inkster is also in the running for the second straight week as she seeks her first win since 2006.

Four players are tied at six-under including Lexi Thompson heading into the weekend at the Los Colinas Country Club.

World number one Lydia Ko narrowly avoided missing her first LPGA cut after bouncing back from a four-over 75 in the opening round to fire a three-under 68.

At one-over for the tournament, she finished on the cut line.

Ko stole the spotlight from Henderson last week by winning the Swinging Skirts but will be hard pressed to do the same again this time around.

A victory for Henderson would see her join Ko and Thompson as the only players on the LPGA Tour to win before the age of 18.

A talented field with a slew of accustomed winners has been assembled for Saturday's Kentucky Derby, and with frontrunners as favorites in a crowded field the start could prove critical.

American Pharoah is the early favorite at 5-2 coming off four wins in a row, while stablemate Dortmund, also trained by three-time Derby winner Bob Baffert, is rated a 3-1 pick and coming to Churchill Downs with six wins in six races.

Third choice Carpe Diem (8-1), trained by Todd Pletcher, has won four of five career races and co-fourth pick Materiality (12-1) is 3-for-3, bidding to become the first horse to win this race for 3-year-olds without racing as a 2-year-old.

The favorites like to run out in front, which could make for a hectic start at Churchill Downs as 19 horses strive to get into favorable position by the first turn.

From Baffert’s perspective, the Derby will be won, and lost, in the moments after the gates open.

“Our horses are not going to be coming from out of the clouds,” said Baffert, whose Dortmund drew the eighth position, while American Pharoah starts from the 17th lane. “The break is going to be the key.”

Riding American Pharoah will be two-time Derby winner Victor Espinoza, who rode last year's champion, California Chrome.

“He rides with a lot of confidence and he’s been here at the big dance,” Baffert said.

Martin Garcia has ridden the unbeaten Dortmund for all his races.

“This is the first time that he’s going to ride a horse that actually has a really good chance to win (the Derby), so I’m sure he will be a little nervous,” Baffert said.

“He knows his horse. He’ll just put him in a nice spot."

Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Maktoum's Mubtaahij, listed at 20-1, won the UAE Derby by eight lengths and will attempt to win the 'Run for the Roses' without the benefit of a single U.S. prep race.

Mubtaahij, who has never been worse than second in his last five starts, would be the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby after racing the UAE Derby.

Mark Casse, trainer of Danzig Moon (30-1), hopes the frontrunners will burn themselves out.

“I would like to see a fast pace and have us be about 10 lengths behind,” Casse said. ”Hopefully the pace comes apart at the seams and we can pick them up.”

World number one Rory McIlroy fought back from two holes down with two to play to beat Billy Horschel at the WGC-Match Play Championship on Friday, while Masters champion Jordan Spieth was knocked out after losing to Lee Westwood.

McIlroy buried a 24-footer for birdie to win the 17th then birdied the last to square the match with FedEx Cup champion Horschel, who faltered with a bogey at the second extra hole to send his opponent into the last 16.

McIlroy, who will play Japan's Hideki Matsuyama in the next round, said he picked the perfect time to hit his best putt of the day on 17.

"Obviously you make the putt or you are going home,” he said. "Hit the best putt that I hit all day, thankfully.

"When I got him up to 18, I knew just try and keep the pressure on him and somehow I was able to turn it around.”

England’s Westwood beat Spieth 2 up, fighting back from an early deficit and ramming home an important 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th to wrestle a lead he would not relinquish.

After missing an 11-foot birdie putt on the first and then making bogey on the second hole, Westwood was two down out of the blocks.

A Spieth bogey on six and a 13-foot birdie putt for Westwood on the ninth squared the match at the turn.

Westwood took the lead a hole later when the 21-year-old American failed to get up and down from just off the green.

After the 11th hole they were square again when Spieth made a birdie from 14 feet.

The pair then traded clutch pars for three holes.

Spieth appeared in trouble when he missed the 15th green but chipped in for birdie. Westwood did not flinch and made his six-foot birdie putt to match.

A hole later it was Westwood with the heroics.

After sending a greenside bunker shot over the green and leaving his next chip short in the rough, the Englishman chipped in for par and Spieth missed his 14-foot birdie chance to stay tied.

Westwood birdie the penultimate hole, leaving Spieth needing to win the 18th, which he was unable to do.

Westwood will play compatriot Danny Willett next up.

Hunter Mahan, the 2012 champion and 2013 runner-up, advanced to the final 16 for the fifth straight year with a crushing 5&4 win over fellow American Matt Kuchar.

Mahan has destroyed his group, winning 7&6 over Stephen Gallacher and 5&3 over Ben Martin over the opening two days.

He will face Australian John Senden, who finished off his group play 3-0 with a 1 up win over Brendon Todd, knocking out world number three Henrik Stenson and former FedEx Cup champion Bill Haas in the process.

In other last 16 ties, Marc Leishman takes on Gary Woodland, Branden Grace faces Tommy Fleetwood, Jim Furky is up against JB Holmes, Louis Oosthuizen faces Rickie Fowler and Charl Schwartzel plays Paul Casey.

The Milwaukee Brewers named Craig Counsell as their new manager on Monday and despite never before managing a single inning, the former major leaguer and his boss were confident he was ready for the job.

Counsell, who has been working as a special assistant to general manager Doug Melvin, takes over from Ron Roenicke, who was fired on Sunday after posting the National League's worst start at 7-18 this season.

"He's played 1,600 games as a player. I told him he was on the bench for about 800 games that he didn't play, and during those games, I know that he was managing in his mind," general manager Doug Melvin said.

"That experience -- the winning experience, the World Series rings, what he's done in the front office working with me over the last three years - is going to be a very big help to him on the field."

Counsell, 44, played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball as a versatile infielder with Colorado, Florida, Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona and Milwaukee, and on winning World Series teams with Florida (1997) and Arizona (2001).

When he addressed the players on Monday afternoon, Counsell was talking to eight former teammates.

"They know where I sit on lots of things, so to me, it's a positive," Counsell said.

"I've said this for years ... we all want to be led. To some extent, we all want to be told what to do," he said. "We have to sacrifice a little bit of ourselves, give a little bit of ourselves, to take the team in the right direction."

Counsell was raised just north of Milwaukee and his father worked in the Brewers' front office in community relations.

"I've watched Brewer games for 35 years. I'm a Milwaukee Brewer. I've always felt that way," Counsell said.

Counsell said he felt right at home in his new job.

"It's a place where I feel like I've prepared myself to be. Surreal was playing. This is probably more where I thought I would end up, in a position of leadership like this.

"It's an honor and it's humbling, but I feel like this is what I was meant to do. I think I'll be better at this than I was at playing."

Roenicke, hired before the 2011 season, compiled a record of 342-331 with Milwaukee.

The Anaheim Ducks extended the only perfect postseason record in the NHL this year when they defeated the Calgary Flames 3-0 Sunday to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Left winger Matt Beleskey, defenseman Hampus Lindholm and center Nate Thompson scored for Anaheim. Center Ryan Getzlaf added two assists, as did right winger Corey Perry, whose 13 playoff points lead the league.

Anaheim goalie Frederik Andersen posted his first career playoff shutout, making 30 saves in the process.

The Ducks are now 6-0 in this year's playoffs, marking the fourth time this season they have had a win streak of six games or more.

They also won their final regular-season game, meaning this is also their third streak of seven victories.

The Flames turned to backup goalie Karri Ramo for his first career postseason start and he rewarded coach Bob Hartley by turning away 31 shots in a loss and keeping his team in the game during a lopsided first period.

The Ducks jumped out to a 1-0 lead 7:37 into the game as Anaheim out-shot Calgary 20-9 in the first period.

Right winger Jakob Silfverberg shipped a puck ahead to center Ryan Kesler, who found Beleskey in the slot for a one-timer. Beleskey has a goal in both games of the series.

The series shifts to Calgary for Game Three on Tuesday.

Andy Murray's preparations for the French Open gathered momentum as he claimed the first claycourt title of his career with a 7-6(4) 5-7 7-6(4) win over twice champion Philipp Kohlschreiber in the rain-delayed Munich Open final on Monday.

The 27-year-old Briton kept his cool in the final that was suspended after only 23 minutes on Sunday, winning the title in his maiden claycourt final appearance.

It was the world number three's first title as a married man and under the guidance of new coach Jonas Bjorkman, who fired him on from the stands.

"This was my first final on clay and to come out and play a match like that, I am very pleased to have won," Murray said in courtside interview before slipping into a traditional Bavarian Lederhose on center court in an amusing award ceremony.

"I had very few chances when I was returning. I was lucky to get a couple of good shots when I was behind in the tiebreak and hang on in the end."

Asked why it took so long for him to win a title on clay and why Britons had not won on the surface in decades, Murray quipped: "It means we're not very good on clay."

The Scot's previous 31 titles had been won on hardcourts, grass and carpet.

The pair had resumed their final with local favorite Kohlschreiber leading 3-2 in the first set and they both confidently held serve to go into the tiebreak.

Murray got the mini break he needed and snatched the set after almost an hour.

Murray, leading 4-3 in the second set, had a golden opportunity to break Kohlschreiber with three break points but the German held his nerve and his serve to clinch the set to level the contest.

The pair traded blows in the third with both holding on to force another tiebreak.

Murray clinched victory on his second match point when Kohlschreiber, winner in Munich in 2007 and 2012, sent a backhand long after three hours, four minutes.

Right winger Patrick Kane scored two goals to lead the Chicago Blackhawks to a 4-1 win against the Minnesota Wild in Game Two of their Western Conference semi-final series on Sunday.

Center Jonathan Toews and left winger Patrick Sharp also scored for Chicago, who seized a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series with their fifth win in as many games on home ice this post-season.

Defenseman Matt Dumba scored the lone goal for Minnesota.

Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford stopped 30-of-31 shots to earn his third win of the playoffs, while Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk turned aside 27-of-30 attempts on goal.

A short-handed goal by Toews broke a scoreless tie with 7:32 remaining in the second period before Chicago doubled their lead on Kane's wrist shot from the right circle with 19.9 seconds remaining in the same frame.

Defenseman Duncan Keith fired a stretch pass to Kane, who wheeled near the blue line and beat Dubnyk stick-side for his 100th career playoff point. Minnesota trimmed the deficit to 2-1 on Dumba's power-play goal with 18:40 left in the third period, the scorer ripping a shot from 40 feet into the top right corner of the net.

The Blackhawks regained a two-goal cushion on a wrist shot by Sharp with 12:21 to go in the third period, left winger Teuvo Teravainen starting the play by stealing the puck along the boards and pushing a pass to the goal-scorer.

Kane added an empty-netter with 2:07 remaining in the third period to complete the scoring.

Game Three is in Minnesota on Tuesday.

South Korean Park In-bee raced past her challengers with a final-round six-under 65 to win the North Texas Shootout by three shots on Sunday. Park began the day tied with American Lexi Thompson, with three others just one stroke behind, but she vaulted in front with two early birdies and never looked back, finishing with a winning total of 15-under 269.

The victory was the second at the tournament in three years for Park, who played the last 18 holes bogey-free.

“I love this golf course. It really suits my eye,” she told reporters of the TPC Las Colinas in Irving. "I love to come here and play.

"The crowds here, the atmosphere is great, so I love to come to Texas."

Park, the second-ranked player in the world entering the tournament, earned her second victory of the season to join compatriot Kim Sei-young and New Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko with multiple LPGA victories this season.

South Korea's Park Hee-young and American Cristie Kerr shot matching 66s to finish tied for second while Thompson finished at 11-under alongside Sweden's Maria McBride.

"(Park) just played a little bit more consistently than me this week ... and I had an even par round, which didn’t help my cause, but I can’t complain,” Kerr said.

Canadian Brooke Henderson, the 17-year-old non-Tour member who has played her way into contention the past two weeks, managed only a two-over 73 to finish tied for 13th at six-under.

Ko experienced a rare off week and narrowly made the cut, ultimately finishing the tournament at even par.

China's world number one Ma Long has set his sights on a maiden table tennis singles gold at the Rio Olympics next year after breaking through for his first world title on home courts in Suzhou.

The 26-year-old had long been overshadowed by champion compatriots Zhang Jike and Wang Hao in China's lofty pecking order but stepped out of their shadows with a 4-2 win over Fang Bo on Sunday.

The win was just reward for hard graft, said Ma, who had been dumped from the semi-finals by the now retired Wang at his three previous world championships.

"It is like a dream come true. Having lost in the semi-finals at the three world championships previously, honestly I have a lot of pressure to earn this title," said Ma, who partnered with Zhang and Wang to win the men's team gold at the London Olympics.

"At the end of the day I think these were worth it.

"Glory is attained from hard work, step by step. I hope I can go up another level at Rio."

Ma's win helped China sweep all four of the men's and women's titles in singles and doubles. China's Xu Xin teamed up with South Korea's Yang Hae-un to win the mixed doubles.

Ma earned special praise from China's men's head coach Liu Guoliang.

"Ma's always been criticized from outside for lacking an edge. I didn't see it that way tonight," Liu, a former Olympic and world singles champion, told Chinese media after the title-decider. "He set his emotions free."

Though Ma took the prize, China can also celebrate the emergence of yet another table tennis force in Fang, who upset the reigning Olympic and world champion Zhang in the semi-finals.

Ma watched the match with interest and was left impressed by the aggression of the previously unsung 23-year-old from the heartland province of Hubei.

"I could feel his momentum was really fierce," Ma said.

Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein suggested on Monday that one candidate rather than three might have a better chance of beating FIFA president Sepp Blatter in this month's elections but said he had no intention of withdrawing from the race.

Earlier media reports suggesting that was he was considering stepping aside were wide of the mark, the 39-year-old Jordanian royal told Reuters and other media in a face-to-face meeting later on Monday.

"What I said earlier has been taken out of context," he said in the grounds of the resort hotel close to where he was hosting the Soccerex Asian Forum at the King Hussein convention center.

"The message I was trying to make is that it would be ideal if we come to a conclusion, who, as a candidate, has the best chance of winning, and we all support that candidate.

"But having said that I am not considering withdrawing from the elections."

Prince Ali told the BBC earlier: "The important thing is that we support the person who has the best chance of making a change in FIFA.

"At some point there will be a discussion about that."

Asked if he would consider withdrawing he replied: "Of course, everything is there -- but it has to be for the candidate with the best possibilities of winning."

Blatter, 79, who has been president since 1998, is seeking a fifth term in office and is expected to get it when FIFA's 209 members cast their votes.

Last week, reports suggesting that the two other challengers Luis Figo of Portugal and Michael van Praag of the Netherlands were considering pulling out of the campaign were strongly dismissed by both of their campaign managers.

Center Steven Stamkos scored a goal and added two assists to lead the Tampa Bay Lightning to a 6-2 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Sunday night at the Bell Center.

The Lightning now head home with a 2-0 series lead in the second-round playoff series.

Goaltender Ben Bishop made 27 saves for Tampa. Carey Price stopped 18 shots for the Canadiens.

Right winger Nikita Kucherov scored twice for the Lightning, who also got goals from center Valtteri Filppula, right winger J.T. Brown and defenseman Victor Hedman.

Defensemen Jeff Petry and Tom Gilbert scored for Montreal, the Canadiens opening the scoring for just the second time in eight playoff games this season.

Stamkos's goal ended an 11-game goal-less drought at 8:06 of the second period.

Game Three is on Wednesday in Tampa Bay.

United States Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn has been named as an honorary ambassador for the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea's Pyeongchang, organizers (POCOG) said on Monday.

Vonn, an Olympic gold medalist at the 2010 Vancouver Games, becomes the first international honorary ambassador for Asia's first Winter Games outside of Japan.

Local athletes undertaking the role include Olympic figure skating gold medalist Kim Yuna, Major League Baseball player Choo Shin-soo and speed skater Lee Kyou-hyuk.

Vonn, who on Sunday announced the break-up of her relationship with Tiger Woods, was scheduled to appear at a ceremony in Seoul on Wednesday to mark her appointment, POCOG said.

New York City FC's poor start to life in Major League Soccer continued on Sunday with a 3-1 home defeat to the Seattle Sounders extending their winless run to seven games.

After winning two of their opening three games in MLS, the new club, formed by Manchester City with the New York Yankees as minority owners, have lost five and drawn twice.

Former England captain Frank Lampard, currently with Manchester City, will join the club after the end of the Premier League season but he may well find himself at a team at the wrong end of the Eastern Conference.

NYCFC are currently eighth out of 10 in the conference, with the top six qualifying for the playoffs.

Obafemi Martins gave Seattle a 23rd minute lead at Yankee Stadium, racing on to a through ball from Marco Pappa and confidently slotting home.

New York drew level when Mehdi Ballouchy fired home from the edge of the area after good work from Patrick Mullins, but Clint Dempsey restored Seattle's advantage a minute later, poking the ball into the far corner.

Martins completed a comfortable win for the Sounders, who are third in the Western Conference, with a left-foot drive after a smart passing move ended with a delightful flick from Dempsey to the Nigerian forward.

"I think these fans deserve a little bit more and a little bit better," New York coach Jason Kreis told reporters. "It keeps me up at night."

The club's biggest signing, former Spain and Barcelona forward David Villa, has been struggling with injuries recently and only came on as a second-half substitute.

In Sunday's other game, a 74th minute header from Paulo Nagamura gave Sporting Kansas City a 1-0 home win over Chicago Fire, who had midfielder David Accam sent off in the 89th minute.

World number one Rory McIlroy became the second golfer after Tiger Woods to win the World Golf Championships Cadillac Match Play as the top seed when he took down American Gary Woodland 4&2 in Sunday's final.

McIlroy defeated Jason Dufner, Brandt Snedeker, Billy Horschel, Hideki Matsuyama, Paul Casey and Jim Furyk before disposing of Woodland to claim his 10th U.S. PGA Tour win and second WGC victory.

“It's been a great week. Match play is a format that I've always enjoyed. I feel it's a format that I do well in and I excel in,” McIlroy said.

“It's really satisfying to get that first win stateside (this year), no matter what format it is, it's always nice to get a trophy.

“And now we move on to next week (The Players Championship) and try to do it again.”

In control with a 4 up lead through 10 holes, McIlroy invited Woodland back into the contest by losing the 11th and 12th holes.

The American could have cut further into the Northern Irishman’s lead but missed a critical three-foot birdie putt on the 13th hole, effectively killing his chances.

A hole later Woodland three-putted the 14th green for a bogey, leaving McIlroy 3 up with four to play.

McIlroy closed it out on the 16th green when Woodland failed to make a birdie and conceded the match.

Earlier Sunday McIlroy had seen off Casey in a darkness-delayed quarter-final, making birdie on their first hole to win in 22 holes.

He then took out Furyk by making birdie on the 17th to tie up their match and moved into the final with a dramatic 44-foot eagle on the 18th green.

Woodland earned his place in the final with a 3&2 win over England’s Danny Willett.

Willett finished the day on a high note by claiming the third place match 3&2 from Furyk. It earned him enough FedEx Cup points to take up special temporary membership on the U.S. tour.

The 27-year-old Englishman, who is running second to McIlroy on the European Tour’s Race to Dubai, can take an unlimited number of sponsors' exemptions on the U.S. tour for the remainder of the year and can earn a full card for the 2015-16 season should he want to take it up.

Heading into the much hyped 'Fight of the Century', Floyd Mayweather Jr. repeatedly said his welterweight showdown with Manny Pacquiao was all about defining his legacy while preserving a perfect record as a professional.

In many ways, it was a case of 'job done' on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena where the 38-year-old American once again showcased his brilliant defensive skills as he won a unanimous decision over Pacquiao in their title bout.

Pacquiao is renowned for his aggression and speed but the Filipino southpaw was continually outsmarted by Mayweather who, despite back peddling for much of the bout, controlled the pace of the fight and the geography of the ring.

Mayweather, a polarizing figure because of his arrogance and flamboyant showmanship, improved his career record to 48-0 and said during the post-fight news conference that he would fight once more, in September, before retiring from the sport.

Should that pan out with the American winning his final bout, he would match the iconic 49-0 record achieved by former heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano.

That would certainly be a legacy.

Yet always with Mayweather there are shades of gray in what could be a stark black-and-white reminder on paper of his superb career as a professional.All too often, he has been criticised for hand-picking his opponents, and there is also the question of his relatively low knockout rate, just 26 for a boxer who prides himself on staying out of harm's way whenever possible in the ring.

Boxing great Oscar De La Hoya, who was beaten by both Mayweather and Pacquiao before calling time on his own glittering career, was distinctly underwhelmed by Saturday's fight - mainly because of the American's style.

"Sorry boxing fans. Call me old school but I like the fans getting their money's worth by watching an action-packed fight," De La Hoya tweeted after what is expected to be the top grossing prize fight of all-time.

"I'm just not into the boxing, running style. I like jumping out of my seat because a fight was existing and the fans got their money's worth."

Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson agreed, tweeting: "We waited 5 years for that... #underwhelmed".

The fact that it took more than five years to make the fight happen was also part of the problem.

TWILIGHT OF CAREERS

Granted, Mayweather and Pacquiao are the greatest boxers of their generation but, at the respective ages of 38 and 36, they are in the twilight of their careers and most pundits believe they have lost some of their skills in the ring.

Had the so-called megafight taken place in 2010, with both men in their prime, their contest could well have been a genuine classic, given their contrasting styles.

For Mayweather, however, Saturday's action and outcome provided proof that he is continually undervalued by the media and by many boxing fans.

"Everyone's been saying for years that Floyd was scared and I would lose (against Pacquiao)," said the American, an 11-time world champion in five weight divisions who expects to make a mind-boggling $200 million from his showdown with Pacquiao.

"I try to keep myself away from negative publicity. Everyone said this guy could beat Floyd, that Floyd is a chicken. The non-believers, well Floyd turned them into believers."

"(Muhammad) Ali called himself the greatest and this is my time. I am TBE (The Best Ever). I strive to be a perfectionist. TBE is not just inside the ring. I am a calculated fighter and I make smart moves outside the ring."

Pro golfer Tiger Woods and U.S. Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn have broken up after a nearly three-year relationship, the pair said on Sunday.

Vonn, 30, used her Facebook page to announce the split before Woods confirmed it on his website.

"After nearly three years together, Tiger and I have mutually decided to end our relationship," Vonn said.

"I will always cherish the memories that we've created together. Unfortunately, we both lead incredibly hectic lives that force us to spend a majority of our time apart."

"I will always admire and respect Tiger. He and his beautiful family will always hold a special place in my heart."

Woods, 39, confirming the breakup, said, "I have great admiration, respect and love for Lindsey and I'll always cherish our time together. She has been amazing with (daughter) Sam and (son) Charlie and my entire family."

"Unfortunately, we lead very hectic lives and are both competing in demanding sports. It's difficult to spend time together."

Woods, a four-times Masters tournament champion, and Vonn, a four-time World Cup ski champion and Olympic gold medalist, announced in 2013 that they were a couple and were routinely seen as spectators at each other's sporting events.

Both went through long recoveries from injuries that prevented them from competing in their respective sports.

Woods played at this year's Masters and is due to compete at the Players Championship this month in Florida.

Vonn returned from knee surgery to break the record for most World Cup ski championship wins by a woman.

Woods, 39, has been single since a 2010 divorce from former Swedish model Elin Nordegren, which occurred less than a year after the golfer became embroiled in an infidelity scandal that rocked the sports world.

More than a dozen women said they had affairs with Woods, and the golfer admitted to "transgressions."

Companies including Accenture Plc (ACN.N), AT&T (T.N) and PepsiCo's (PEP.N) Gatorade ended their sponsorship deals with Woods in the wake of the scandal.

High school and college football players suffer more concussions during practices than during games, according to a new study.

This is simply because there are more practices than games, said lead author Thomas P. Dompier of the Datalys Center for Sports Injury Research and Prevention in Indianapolis, Indiana.

When the number of concussions is divided by the number of field appearances, the concussion rate is actually higher during games, he said.

Dompier and colleagues used reports from three large surveillance systems in the U.S. to study concussions in 118 youth football teams, 96 high school programs and 24 college institutions in the 2012 and 2013 seasons.

In total, more than 1,000 concussions were reported. About 66 percent were in high school students.

For youth players age five to 14, almost 54 percent of concussions happened during games, compared to about 42 percent of high school and college concussions, the researchers reported in JAMA Pediatrics.

The rate was highest in college, with almost four concussions per 1,000 participations in a game, compared to 2.4 for youth players and about two for high-schoolers.

The average athlete needs up to two weeks to stop having symptoms like headaches and memory problems, but kids who have had multiple concussions may need longer to recover, with memory and attention problems sometimes lasting a year.

When coaches and football parents are educated about proper tackling technique, equipment fitting, recognize the signs and symptoms of concussion, heat injury, sudden athlete death, and other injuries, practices can be safer, Dompier said.

“From my experience working as an athletic trainer, college coaches rarely schedule full-contact drills during practice focusing more on strategy and tactics,” he said. “At the youth and high school levels, coaches still teach tackling, and in my opinion, most still mistakenly believe the only way they can teach tackling is through player-to-player contact.”

Most youth coaches are volunteers, he noted, but there are practical solutions, like the USA Football’s Heads Up Football coaching certification program.

“The majority are occurring in practices, so we need to figure out what we can do to try to prevent those,” said Dr. Frederick P. Rivara of the University of Washington in Seattle who was not part of the new study.

“They could have more non-collision practices,” Rivara, the editor of JAMA Pediatrics, told Reuters Health by phone.

Policies can also limit how much time is devoted to full or player-to-player contact, eliminating specific drills that create injurious situations such as the Oklahoma Drill, Dompier said. 

“A few examples include Pop Warner’s recent improvements to their practice policies, USA Football’s Youth Football Practice Guidelines, and the NFHS also recently released practice guidelines for high school football,” Dompier said. “Minimally, organizations should at least follow those guidelines that are appropriate for their level of play.”

Governing bodies, organization officials, coaches, and parents are starting to take the issue of concussion and other injuries seriously and are taking steps to make not only football, but all sports safer, he said.

“People are more aware that concussions are occurring,” Rivara said. “Secondly they are aware that while the majority get better within two weeks, some do not.”

In Canada, he noted, a rules change increased the age at which body-checking could start, and concussion rates in younger kids went down.

“We’re not suggesting football should stop being played, but we are concerned,” he said.

With Park In-bee's victory at the North Texas Shootout on Sunday South Korean golfers have won seven of the first 11 LPGA Tour events this season and the world number two says the battle for a spot on the Korean Olympic team is driving them hard.

Golf returns to the Summer Games in Rio next year for the first time since 1904, with 60 players qualifying for the men's and women's events.

The top 15 in the world qualify automatically, with a limit of four per country, and the remaining places go to the highest ranked players from countries that do not already have two golfers qualified.

According to International Golf Federation rankings, Park would currently be joined by LPGA Tour rookie Kim Hyo-joo, Ryu So-yeon and Amy Yang, although qualification places will not be decided until next year.

None of the four can take their spots for granted, though, with Lee Mi-rim, Kim Sei-young, Choi Na-yeon, Baek Kyu-jung and Jang Ha-na all inside the world top 20.

Park said the incredible run of victories on the LPGA Tour this season, which would rise to nine of 11 with the inclusion of South Korean-born Kiwi Lydia Ko, could be a reflection of the desire to grab a coveted Olympic berth.

"I don't know the exact cause, but maybe it's because players are concentrating really hard right now with the Olympics coming up next year," South Korea's Yonhap News quoted Park as saying.

"The way the players look at it, the qualification period for the Olympics has already begun so they are really concentrating hard and pushing each other."

Park said the impressive performances of Tour rookies Kim Hyo-joo and Kim Sei-young had also been a reminder to established players that they had to keep improving or risk being left behind.

At 19, Kim Hyo-joo already has a major to her name after winning the 2014 Evian Championship while she was still playing on the Korean Tour, and she earned her second LPGA victory at the JTBC Founders Cup in March.

Kim Sei-young, 22, is a two-time winner this season and would have claimed her first major at last month's ANA Inspiration but for a meltdown in the final round.

"The rookies on the LPGA Tour this year like Kim Sei-young and Kim Hyo-joo have really motivated the players who have been here for a while," said Park, who at 26 has already claimed five majors and almost $11 million in prize money.

"Watching them put in these great performances we are saying to ourselves, 'we can't afford to stand still'."

Rory McIlroy outplayed Jordan Spieth in a duel between the world's two top-ranked players, but another young gun stole the show with the clubhouse lead during the opening round of the Players Championship on Thursday.

Hideki Matsuyama, of Japan, fired a five-under 67 to take the lead at TPC Sawgrass, one shot ahead of Americans Billy Horschel, Ben Martin and Troy Merritt with half the field back in the clubhouse in the $10 million event.

Northern Irishman McIlroy, who played with Spieth and world number seven Jason Day, put together a steady three-under 69 to be part of a logjam of players just two back. Australian Day matched McIlroy but Masters champion Spieth struggled to a three-over 75 and fell eight off the early pace.

Matsuyama put up six birdies and just a lone bogey at the first, his 10th hole.

“I putted very well today. That was the difference,” the 23-year-old told reporters through an interpreter.

McIlroy, who arrived only on tournament eve after taking a couple of days off following his WGC-Match Play victory on Sunday, continued his good form.

He played the back nine first and started with a run of five pars before a neat birdie on the 15th preceded a brilliant eagle on the par-five 16th, where he hit his second shot to seven feet.

The 26-year-old gave a stroke back with a bogey on the first but dropped in a 14-foot birdie on the eighth.

“It's about staying patient,” McIlroy said of his round. “There's a lot of pars on my card, but I was able to pick off a couple of birdies and a nice eagle on 16, so pleased with the start. “I felt conditions got quite tricky out there at the end with the wind. It swirls a lot around here, and made club selection a little bit more difficult."

But Spieth looked a pale shadow of the man who blew away the field at the Masters only four weeks ago, and he admitted he was having trouble trusting his swing after a round that included five bogeys and just two birdies.

“A really tough ball striking day, just couldn't find anything really since I have gotten here on Monday,” said the Texan. “I was looking for something in my alignment, just didn't quite trust it today until I was already too far behind the eight-ball. So, yeah, just a really, really poor day.”

Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton says he can see something of himself in Manny Pacquiao, even if the Filipino lost the 'Fight of the Century' last weekend.

The Mercedes driver had a ringside seat at the welterweight's title fight in Las Vegas with Floyd Mayweather Jr. and surprisingly identified more with the beaten boxer than the winner.

"When I was watching the fight, I felt Pacquaio won. He was the attacking one," Hamilton told reporters at the Spanish Grand Prix on Thursday.

"I felt I had more similarities with him, watching his style, I was thinking he’s the attacking guy, he’s out there, he’s hungry. He wants it more than anything.

"But otherwise I’ve not really learnt anything from those guys, apart from they wear much bigger shorts than me," he grinned.

Hamilton, winner of three of four races so far this season, faces his own fight at the Circuit de Catalunya this weekend and can deliver another big blow to team mate and title rival Nico Rosberg.

The Briton, who has a 27 point lead over the German, has started every race in pole position this season and won in Barcelona from pole last year.

While every team is hoping to make a step up in the first round of the season in Europe, now that they have had time back at their factories after the long-haul openers, Hamilton was confident Mercedes could stay ahead.

"I feel confident that the team have done everything they could and that they can do to be as strong as they can this weekend and to improve," he said.

"I think others will have improved as well but I’m confident in my guys. We’ve not come with a ton of upgrades...it's generally not the philosophy of the team to just pile on lots of different things.

"We’ve come with quality upgrades rather than quantity," added the double champion who spent most of the three week break between Bahrain and Spain in the United States with his half-brother Nicolas.

He sent his 1.2 million Instagram followers photographs from Los Angeles, where he took his classic Cobra sportscar out for a spin along the coast, Las Vegas and New York.

"I am probably the happiest I have been for a long, long time. Career-wise and then outside," he said on Thursday as he turned his focus back to Formula One.

Fernando Alonso can see a brighter future for McLaren, despite turning up at his home Spanish Grand Prix on Thursday with a stye in his eye.

The double world champion kept his heavy sunglasses on throughout a news conference at the Circuit de Catalunya and told reporters he had to protect his vision.

"I have a stye," he explained. "A little inflammation of my eye. They recommend not to be too much in the artificial light. I try to protect a little bit the eye today and tomorrow to be ready for Saturday and Sunday."

The last time Alonso appeared at the circuit outside Barcelona was in February, when he crashed heavily in the second of three pre-season tests.

The medical advice that followed that incident was to rest and recover from concussion, meaning he missed the Australian season-opener in Melbourne.

Alonso said he had no lingering concerns about that accident or getting back out on track and returned with full confidence and motivation.

He also planned a thank you gesture for the hospital staff who had looked after him.

"They were so kind to me and I plan to have dinner with them, probably on Sunday," he said. "I stay here on Monday for one event with a sponsor, so Sunday night after all the stress and the race; more in a quiet place."

McLaren have had a stressful start to the season and their new engine partnership with Honda, qualifying near the rear of the field and failing to score in the first four races.

At the last one, in Bahrain, Alonso's British team mate Jenson Button did not even get to start although the Spaniard finished 11th.

"I think in Bahrain we had a nice step and that brought us closer to the Q3 (final stage of qualifying) and also to the points and we need another small step to reach that goal," said Alonso.

"We want to be on the podium and win races but one step at a time and hopefully here in Barcelona we can see this step."

Alonso, twice a winner of his home race with Renault and Ferrari, said it was just a question of time and putting everything together before McLaren were competitive again.

"I really think that we have the potential to fight with the top teams in future," he said.

Local hero Rafa Nadal raced into the last eight of the Madrid Open when he brushed aside unseeded Italian Simone Bolelli 6-2 6-2 on Thursday to set up a quarter-final clash against Bulgarian 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov.

Chasing a third straight title at the clay Masters event in the Spanish capital, and a fifth overall, third seed Nadal needed little more than an hour to see off an outclassed Bolelli, saving both break points he faced on his serve.

The Majorcan has a good chance of claiming another Madrid crown as world number one Novak Djokovic pulled out to rest and Roger Federer, who took over from the Serb as the top seed, fell to Australian Nick Kyrgios in the second round on Wednesday.

After struggles with injury and illness, Nadal is attempting to rediscover his best form on his favored surface before he makes a bid for a record-extending 10th French Open singles title in Paris starting at the end of the month.

He won a 46th career clay title in Buenos Aires in February and is just three shy of the record of 49 held by Guillermo Vilas, but fell short at subsequent clay tournaments in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, two events he has won multiple times.

Dimitrov earlier edged eighth-seeded Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, who Nadal beat in the 2013 Madrid final, 7-6(5) 3-6 6-3 and the Spaniard said he was expecting a tough contest against a man he has beaten in all five of their previous meetings, including twice on clay.

"Yeah, everything worries me about Dimitrov," Nadal told a news conference.

"He's a very good player. He serves well, very good forehand. Backhand, too. Slice also.

"He moves very well and has good footwork. He is a very complicated player. All round. Only way to beat him is to play at really high level.

"Let's see what happens. I hope I'm going to be ready for the match and I'm going to have fun."

Czech Tomas Berdych, the sixth seed, also claimed a berth in the last eight when he cruised past 12th-seeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5 6-2.

Berdych, who lost to Federer in the 2012 final, will play 16th seed John Isner on Friday for a place in the last four.

American Isner brought Kyrgios back down to earth with a hard-fought 6-3 6-7(7) 6-4 success.

On the other side of the draw, second seed Andy Murray takes on unseeded Spaniard Marcel Granollers later on Thursday and is on course to meet fifth seed Milos Raonic of Canada in the quarter-finals.

The team behind Tom Brady ran defense for the star quarterback on Thursday after a report found he likely knew footballs were deflated to the New England Patriots' advantage in a scandal that could lead to a multigame suspension and a tainted legacy.

As Brady's agent issued a stinging rebuke of the findings, the National Football League clammed up the day after releasing the 243-page "Deflategate" report, refusing to give a timetable or range on possible sanctions against Brady or the Patriots.

The four-time Super Bowl winner and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player may make his first public comments later Thursday when he is scheduled to speak at Salem State University, just north of Boston and take questions.

The report brought the seemingly obscure subject of deflating footballs out of the sports realm as the accusations dogged Brady, one of the most prominent sport stars in the United States, and the Patriots, arguably one of the NFL's top teams over the last 20 years.

Ted Wells, an attorney hired by the NFL to investigate 'Deflategate,' said in his report the Patriots probably deliberately deflated footballs in their 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC championship game that put them into the Super Bowl.

Brady, 37, a likely future Hall of Famer married to supermodel Gisele Bündchen, was probably "at least generally aware" of the violations, the report said.

Don Yee, Brady's agent, said in a statement Thursday the report's "omission of key facts ... suggest(s) the investigators reached a conclusion first, and then determined so-called facts later."

As the NFL went through a tumultuous year that included high-profile cases of domestic abuse by players, Patriots owner Robert Kraft stood behind embattled Commissioner Roger Goodell, which some believe could affect how tough a penalty the league would hand down to Brady or the team.

Goodell said any discipline would be handled by Troy Vincent, NFL vice president of football operations, although observers think the commissioner could conceivably pull the strings behind the scenes.

The NFL's punishment could include Brady being suspended for a few games next season, fines for the team and the loss of draft picks.

"The Brady haters will hate but at the very least even his most ardent fans must feel a sense of disappointment," Hank Gola, NFL writer with the New York Daily News, told Reuters. "He can't emerge unscathed, no matter where this goes from here."

Kraft's team has been caught trying to gain an edge before.

Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000 in 2007 for illegally videotaping defensive signals from New York Jets coaches in what has been dubbed "Spygate."

The Patriots were also fined $250,000 and forfeited a first-round draft pick.

Other NFL teams have been punished recently for breaking rules.

This past March, the Atlanta Falcons were fined $350,000 and lost a draft pick in 2016 for piping in artificial noise to hinder visiting teams trying to call plays in the Georgia Dome.

Top seed Serena Williams and defending champion Maria Sharapova remained on course for a heavyweight Madrid Open final showdown with contrasting victories in the last eight of the clay premier event on Thursday.

Williams, who triumphed in the Spanish capital in 2012 and 2013, when she beat Sharapova in the final, swept past local favourite Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 6-1 6-3.

Sharapova earlier had to recover from dropping the second set and going a break down in the third to beat Caroline Wozniacki 6-1 3-6 6-3.

Suarez Navarro, who had never beaten the American world number one in five previous meetings, was powerless to prevent a fired-up Williams securing a last-four clash against Czech fourth seed Petra Kvitova, the 2011 champion, or unseeded Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu, who play their quarter-final later on Thursday.

Williams, who saved three match points in Wednesday's victory over Victoria Azarenka, is looking to hone her claycourt game before making a bid for a third French Open crown in Paris starting at the end of this month.

She won a sixth Australian Open title at the start of the year, her 19th grand slam singles title.

"I think Maria is playing well," Williams told a news conference.

"I saw her play today ... she really picked up her level and her game.

"I don't know, right now I think she's probably a big favorite to win this. Yeah, she's playing great."

Dane Wozniacki, a Madrid finalist in 2009 and like Sharapova a former world number one, had her service broken five times by the statuesque Russian, who is chasing a 35th career title.

Sharapova called on her coach for advice after losing her serve at the start of the third set and said it had been a turning point.

"I had a good start but my level obviously dropped and I became much more inconsistent and passive," she told a news conference.

"So I think that a little bit of a switch (helped) and just (being) a little bit more aggressive and going a little bit for my shots, moving forward," she added.

"It was more of a mental change as well. Just looking for the next shot and creating a few extra steps in my footwork."

Sharapova will return to number two in the world if she reaches the final.

Her semi-final opponent will be the winner of Thursday's match between Czech 13th seed Lucie Safarova and unseeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova.

Double Olympic champion Tina Maze announced on Thursday that she has decided to take a year-long break from one of the most successful careers in skiing to consider her future.

"After 16 long and successful seasons, practicing all disciplines, I feel that my body and my mind need a longer rest than usual," the 32-year-old Slovenian wrote in a blog on her website.

"I will allow myself a one year break before taking any further decision."

Maze, who finished second in the women's overall World Cup standings in March, said she would devote the coming months to completing her university studies and working for her sponsors.

Maze's decision puts a question mark over a glittering career which reached a hight point with last year's golds in both the downhill and giant slalom at the Sochi Olympics.

She also became world champion in downhill and super-combined in February this year after being honoured as the best sportswoman in Slovenia for the fifth time at the end of last year.

"I will use this opportunity to finish my degree and give some of my time for marketing and communication activities to my partners...and other projects that I have in mind," wrote Maze, who has been studying to become a school teacher.

The failed Caterham Formula One team's Leafield factory in central England is to be sold off with auctioneers saying on Thursday they were seeking offers of more than 5.5 million pounds ($8.36 million).

BNP Paribas Real Estate and Carter Jonas said they had been appointed by administrators to sell the facility which previously housed the now-defunct Super Aguri and Arrows F1 teams.

Caterham, founded by Malaysian Airasia airline entrepreneur Tony Fernandes as Lotus Racing in 2010, failed to score a point in five seasons in Formula One and went into administration with 200 staff made redundant last October.

They folded after raising money through crowd-funding to compete at last year's Abu Dhabi season-ender.

The team's cars and other factory equipment has been sold off through a series of auctions.

British driver Will Stevens, who raced for the team in Abu Dhabi and is now with tail-enders Manor Marussia, told reporters at the Spanish Grand Prix on Thursday he had considered buying as a memento the steering wheel to the car he drove.

"It would be cool to have my steering wheel from my first grand prix to keep but I'm not sure if it's still around any more," he said. "I'm not sure how much it would even go for."

Boxing will no longer be part of the World Combat Games and the international federation is also leaving the SportAccord umbrella organization after its row with the International Olympic Committee, AIBA said on Thursday.

The federation is the latest to leave SportAccord, an organization representing close to 100 Olympic and non-Olympic sports federations and organizers of multi-sports games, after SportAccord President Marius Vizer's scathing attack on the IOC last month.

"We have aimed to create a clear identity for the sport of boxing in the past 8 years of my presidency," said AIBA chief Ching-Kuo Wu in a statement.

"Boxing is a noble art and a traditional Olympic sport and we feel that the participation in the World Combat Games challenges this identity among boxing fans."

The decision is a further blow to Vizer, who emerged as a self-styled reformer of international sport when he took over the SportAccord presidency two years ago.

He instantly clashed with the IOC, proposing the creation of the United World Championships, a possible competitor to the Olympics, a project that has not materialized

Vizer, who also heads the international judo federation, said last month the IOC was dated and in need of serious reform and it should stop interfering in the autonomy of other sports bodies.

In a heads-on collision Vizer accused the IOC of blocking the creation of other events and deciding which sports could compete where, in an unprecedented attack launched in front of the entire Olympic leadership at the SportAccord convention in Sochi.

"It is with much regret that we suspend our membership with SportAccord with immediate effect. AIBA’s work is based on the Olympic values and it is the values of integrity and respect that we must protect first and foremost," Wu said.

AIBA had been a member of SportAccord since 1967 and boxing had been part of the SportAccord World Combat Games in Saint Petersburg in 2013 and Beijing in 2010.

It joins several other federations, including athletics (IAAF) to withdraw from the organization.

The 2017 World Combat Games, which include sports such as aikido, fencing, judo, karate, kickboxing, sambo, weightlifting and wrestling among other, will be held in Lima, Peru.

After AIBA's withdrawal only five of the 16 World Combat Games sports are Olympic sports.

Manny Pacquiao underwent successful arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder on Wednesday, just days after his loss to Floyd Mayweather in the so-called "Fight of the Century".

Surgeon Neal ElAttrache, who performed the operation to repair a torn rotator cuff, said he could "not be more pleased with the results" and expects Pacquiao to recover fully.

Pacquiao, the former eight-division world champion, lost a unanimous decision to Mayweather in Las Vegas last weekend in the richest prize fight in boxing history.

The Filipino southpaw entered the fight with a shoulder injury that was suffered during preparation for the bout. The Nevada State Athletic Commission could fine or suspend Pacquiao for failing to disclose the injury.

The non disclosure could also lead to possible lawsuits from boxing fans who may feel cheated after paying record sums for tickets in the MGM Grand Garden Arena or pay-for-view (PPV).

Some of the ringside spots in the 16,800-seat arena demanded up to $350,000 on resale site StubHub, while a record $300 million or more is expected in PPV revenue.

Talks over a potential rematch between Mayweather (48-0) and Pacquiao (57-6-2), once his health resumes, have already began, according to media reports.

Chinese challengers Dongfeng Race Team won an enthralling duel with event leaders Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing to claim the sixth leg of the Volvo Ocean Race late on Wednesday and reignite their hopes of an overall victory.

Dongfeng had been forced to retire during the previous leg to Itajai, Brazil, when their mast broke in the Southern Ocean, 200 nautical miles (nm) from Cape Horn.

The crew nursed their stricken boat to safety but the shore crew had just under a week to repair the vessel and fit a new rig ready for the start of the stage from Brazil to Newport, Rhode Island.

Skipper Charles Caudrelier and his crew then sailed a brilliant leg to wrest victory from Abu Dhabi but were pushed all the way in the final 24 hours, winning with just three minutes and 25 seconds to spare.

Dutch challengers Team Brunel finished third, under an hour behind the leading two, with Spanish boat MAPFRE in fourth. Team Alvimedica (Turkey/U.S.) looked likely to claim fifth ahead of Team SCA (Sweden), which has an all-women crew.

Caudrelier paid tribute to his shore crew for setting up the victory.

"For this leg, the goal was to be ready in Itajai and the (shore) crew did a fantastic job. I'd like to give them credit for the victory," he told reporters. Caudrelier's hopes of victory had looked in serious jeopardy two days after the April 19 start of the leg when the electronic water-maker, which converts sea water into drinking water, broke down.

The Frenchman said if his crew had not been able to repair it, they would have had to make a 12-hour stop.

The boats will now have 10 days in dock for maintenance before returning to the offshore action with the transatlantic leg to Lisbon, Portugal.

Two legs to France and Sweden follow before the 38,739nm event concludes on June 27 in Gothenburg.

Washington Capitals left winger Andre Burakovsky scored his first two career playoff goals in a 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers.

Burakovsky tied the score in the second period and netted the game-winner just 24 seconds into the third period on a breakaway.

Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby did the rest, allowing just one goal on 29 shots to earn his sixth victory of the playoffs and give the Capitals a commanding 3-1 lead in the series.

Game Five will be played on Friday at Madison Square Garden in New York.

While Burakovsky's individual exploits made him the star of the night, the game's most pivotal moment came with just under 12 minutes remaining in regulation when Holtby stopped Rangers left winger Carl Hagelin on a penalty shot.

Hagelin was awarded the shot after Washington defenseman Mike Green hooked him from behind and took away a scoring chance on a clean breakaway.

With a chance to tie the game, Hagelin weaved in on Holtby and went forehand to backhand. But Holtby stayed with him and snatched Hagelin's backhander with his catching glove.

The Rangers have made a habit of scoring first in the playoffs and they did it for the sixth time in nine playoff games.

Center Derick Brassard finishing off a perfectly timed feed from right winger Martin St. Louis to score his team-high fifth goal of the playoffs with 6:12 gone in the second period.

Center Tyler Johnson scored with 1.1 seconds left in regulation as the Tampa Bay Lightning edged the Montreal Canadiens 2-1 to take a 3-0 stranglehold on the Eastern Conference semi-final series on Wednesday night.

Johnson broke the deadlock in a game that looked destined for overtime with his eighth goal of the playoffs, taking a centering pass in front of the net and pushing it past Montreal goaltender Carey Price.

Lightning goalie Ben Bishop carried a shutout well into the third period but Montreal tied the game when right winger Brendan Gallagher, diving to the net, pushed a rebound under his pad to tie the game at 1-1 with 9:57 left.

Lightning center Alex Killorn had scored a first-period goal to give Tampa the early advantage.

With eight minutes left in the opening period, Killorn was set up with a strong entry pass from Lightning center Steven Stamkos, who picked up his sixth assist.

Tampa Bay, winners of five straight in the playoffs, can finish the series with a win at home on Thursday night.

The Canadiens had more scoring opportunities through two periods, outshooting the Lightning 8-6 in the opening period and holding them without a shot for the first 12 minutes of the second.

Beijing has extended a ban on outdoor barbecues to restaurants operating in some suburban areas as it tries to improve its notoriously poor air quality in case it wins the 2022 Winter Olympics, state news agency Xinhua reported.

Barbecues, generally used to cook popular street foods like kebabs, are already banned within the city's fourth ring road. The government blames them for contributing to smog, despite much public ridicule that dirty factories are more to blame.

The outlying suburb of Tongzhou, as well as parts of Shunyi, Miyun, Pinggu and Fangshan, will now have to follow the ban, the report issued late on Wednesday said, citing the Beijing Municipal Bureau of City Administration and Law Enforcement.

Xinhua said this was part of efforts to ensure air quality is up to scratch in case Beijing wins the 2022 Games, a decision that will be made in late July. Only the Kazakh city of Almaty is bidding against Beijing.

"China is going all out to bring 'Olympic Blue' to Beijing," Xinhua said. "Air pollution, which had haunted the city for quite a long time, is believed to be one of the major problems hurting Beijing's chance for the 2022 Games."

While Beijing made strenuous efforts to clean up its air in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics, the city still suffers from terrible smog, so bad on occasion that it forces the airport to shut and envelops everything with a thick, choking haze.

Average levels of hazardous airborne particles, known as PM2.5, stood at 85.9 micrograms per cubic meters in 2014, down four percent compared with the previous year. That is still far higher than the national air quality standard of 35 micrograms.

Beijing plans to bring readings down to 60 by 2017, the municipal environmental bureau said earlier this year.

Roger Federer became the latest big name to get sucked up by a whirlwind called Nick Kyrgios as the Australian tyro sent the Swiss top seed spinning out of the Madrid Masters in the second round on Wednesday.

Ten months after the then 144th-ranked Kyrgios overwhelmed Rafa Nadal in the Wimbledon fourth round with a fearless brand of tennis, the Australian showed that he is a force to be reckoned with on clay too.

Now ranked 35th on the back of contesting his first ever ATP final in Estoril last weekend, Kyrgios brought an abrupt end to Federer's hopes of winning a fourth Madrid trophy with a heart-pumping 6-7(2) 7-6(5) 7-6(12) victory.

"I think he's the greatest of all time... I knew before the match that I would have to play one of the greatest matches I have ever played, I wasn't intimidated at all," the remarkably composed 20-year-old said courtside following his victory in two hours 37 minutes.

"It doesn't really feel real at the moment. It's a strange feeling... it's pretty exciting."

While Kyrgios was celebrating what he called "definitely the greatest win of my career", Federer was condemned to his earliest exit in 11 visits to Madrid.

On the day he had hoped to celebrate the first birthday of his twin boys Lenny and Leo with a routine victory, the world number two was first rankled when Kyrgios broke him in the opening game of the match.

The irritation went up a few notches as he was heard snapping "We need a clown for this circus" when the second set slipped away from his grasp under a barrage of aces and crunching baseline winners.

Facing an opponent who was just eight when he won the first of his record 17 grand slam titles in 2003, Federer wasted two match points in the tension-filled third set tiebreak.

Instead Kyrgios was the one holding his arms aloft in victory after he wrapped up the contest on his sixth match point when Federer slammed a forehand wide.

Following a disappointing season in which he has claimed only one low-key title, Nadal went back to using his old racket model to record a 6-4 6-3 win over American Steve Johnson.

He was joined in the third round by Tomas Berdych and 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov but U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic followed Federer out of the exit door after a 6-7(5) 7-6(5) 6-3 defeat by Fernando Verdasco.

Kei Nishikori also progressed with a 6-2 4-6 6-4

victory over Belgian David Goffin, while second seed Andy Murray rounded out the day's action with a 6-4 3-6 6-0 victory over Philipp Kohlschreiber.

The New England Patriots probably deliberately deflated the footballs to gain an advantage in the AFC title game in January, and quarterback Tom Brady was "at least generally aware" of the scheme, the National Football League said on Wednesday.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league would consider possible disciplinary action and what rules, if any, need to be changed.

"At the same time, we will continue our efforts vigorously to protect the integrity of the game," he said.

A 243-page report was released by Ted Wells, an attorney hired by the league to investigate allegations that the Patriots purposely deflated the balls used in their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.

"We have concluded that, in connection with the AFC Championship Game, it is more probable than not that New England Patriots personnel participated in violations of the playing rules and were involved in a deliberate effort to circumvent the rules," the report said.

The report also concluded that Brady, a four-time Super Bowl champion and future Hall of Famer, "was at least generally aware" of the arrangement. Brady has previously denied knowledge about the underinflated balls in a scandal known as Deflategate.

Patriots CEO Robert Kraft said he does not agree with the report's findings but would not challenge them.

"While I respect the independent process of the investigation, the time, effort and resources expended to reach this conclusion are incomprehensible to me," Kraft said. "Knowing that there is no real recourse available, fighting the league and extending this debate would prove to be futile."

After routing the Colts in the AFC championship, the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 28-24, in the Super Bowl, a feat many believe was tarnished by the scandal.

The NFL has rules on the minimum amount of air that must be in footballs and many believe underinflating them would give a quarterback an advantage in gripping the ball, especially during the chilly conditions like those in the AFC title game.

Jim McNally, a locker room attendant for the Patriots, and John Jastremski, an equipment assistant, likely participated in the plan to release air from the balls after they were examined by the referee, the report concluded.

"To say we are disappointed in (the report's) findings, which do not include any incontrovertible or hard evidence of deliberate deflation of footballs at the AFC championship game, would be a gross understatement," Kraft said.
