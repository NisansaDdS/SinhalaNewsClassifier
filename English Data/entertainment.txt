Veteran blues guitarist B.B. King said Friday he was in hospice care at his home, less than a month after he was hospitalized for diabetes-related issues.

In a message posted on his official Facebook page, the 89-year-old singer said he was receiving care at his Las Vegas residence.

"Thanks to all for your well wishes and prayers," he said in the post.

King was taken to a hospital in April after suffering from dehydration as a complication of diabetes. He left shortly after and said he was "feeling much better" at the time.

Born in Mississippi, the singer is known as the "King of the Blues" and is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time, with artists such as Eric Clapton citing him as an influence.

Last October, King was forced to cancel eight live performances after falling ill on stage in Chicago. He was diagnosed with dehydration and suffering from exhaustion.

The rebooted "Star Wars" franchise hit a bump on Friday as filmmaker Josh Trank, who was selected to direct one of the upcoming standalone films, said he was stepping down from the project to pursue other "creative opportunities."

Trank, 30, the director of 2012's sci-fi movie "Chronicle" and the upcoming "Fantastic Four" movie, was selected to direct the second "Star Wars Anthology" due out in 2018. The three anthology films will intersect a new trilogy in the franchise, kicking off with "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in December.

"After a year of having the incredible honour of developing with the wonderful and talented people at Lucasfilm, I'm making a personal decision to move forward on a different path," Trank said in a statement on StarWars.com.

"I've put a tremendous amount of thought into this, and I know deep down in my heart that I want to pursue some original creative opportunities."

Lucasfilm's vice president of development, Kiri Hart, added, "We are grateful for the energy and love of Star Wars that he brought to the process."

No replacement for Trank has been named yet.

"The Force Awakens," directed by J.J. Abrams, is the first of a new "Star Wars" trilogy being produced by Walt Disney Co since it purchased the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion. It is expected to be one of the biggest box office hits later this year, and its two trailers have already amassed millions of views amid frenzied fan interest.

"Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One," directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Felicity Jones, is the first of the standalone films and is due out in 2016.

"Star Wars," created by filmmaker George Lucas, grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since 1977 with six films and has become embedded in pop culture, spawning a legion of devoted fans.

Franchise stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will all return in "The Force Awakens."

Two more women, a writer and an actress, on Friday said comedian Bill Cosby had sexually assaulted them decades ago, bringing the list of his accusers to more than 40.

Actress Lili Bernard and writer Sammie Mays made the allegations against the comedian at a news conference with prominent lawyer Gloria Allred the day before the last show of Cosby's national comedy tour in Atlanta.

Cosby, best known for his role as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the hit TV series "The Cosby Show," has never been charged over any of the allegations. The 77-year-old settled a 2005 civil lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct.

His representative did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has previously dismissed similar allegations by other women as "discredited" and "defamatory."

Bernard said Cosby drugged, raped and threatened her while he helped her prepare for a role in the 1984-1992 show's last season.

"After he had won my complete trust and admiration, he drugged and raped me," said the mother of six.

Bernard said she told her agent, family, several friends and her pastor about the attack. She later became suicidal and was hospitalized.

"I still suffer panic attacks and night terrors as a result of what Mr. Cosby did to me," she said. "I stand here to take back my power and confront the fear that has paralyzed me for so many years."

Bernard and Allred said they went to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where one of the alleged attacks occurred, on Thursday to report it to the police. New Jersey has no statute of limitations for rape.

The Atlantic City Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Sammie Mays said she was a writer at a television convention in New Orleans in 1986 when Cosby agreed to an interview. After accompanying him to his hotel room and accepting a drink, she said she woke up confused and partially undressed as Cosby stared down at her. She said she quickly tried to compose herself, then left.

"Once in the lobby, I realized I had just survived an

encounter with a scheming madman who hid his demons behind an alluring personality," she said.

Allred, who represents many of Cosby's accusers, said she will join a planned protest on Saturday at the Atlanta theater where Cosby is scheduled to perform.

Olympic champion and reality television star Bruce Jenner was sued for negligence and wrongful death on Friday by relatives of a woman killed in a car crash involving the former athlete on a Southern California highway in February.

The complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by two stepchildren of Kimberly Howe, who died in the Feb. 7 collision on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that sheriff's deputies said had left five other people injured.

The lawsuit claims Jenner was driving his Cadillac Escalade, towing a trailer with an off-road vehicle, when he struck Howe's car from the rear, propelling her automobile into oncoming traffic, and she collided head-on with another vehicle.

According to the suit, Jenner "violated the rules of the road" and was "negligent, careless and reckless" in causing the wreck, though the six-page complaint did not specify how Jenner was alleged to have been at fault. By contrast, Howe was "acting with due caution, attention and care" and did not contribute to the crash, the suit said.

Jenner's publicist, Alan Nierob, declined comment on the case.

The wrongful death claim seeks unspecified damages for the personal loss of Howe and her financial support to her stepdaughter, Dana Redmond, and stepson William Howe.

Kimberly Howe's obituary said she and her deceased husband of 32 years ran a national health food business, and that she previously played bit parts in several Elvis Presley movies.

The suit came one week after Jenner declared in a nationally televised interview that he identifies as a woman, becoming the most high-profile American to come out as transgender. Nierob, however, has said Jenner still prefers to be referred to with male pronouns.

Jenner, 65, rose to fame with a record-breaking Olympic gold medal victory in the decathalon in the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal that earned him the unofficial title of "World's Greatest Athlete."

Known to younger generations as the patriarch of reality TV's Kardashian clan, Jenner appeared on ABC's "20/20" last Friday to put to rest months of speculation that he was transitioning to life as a woman.

The interview was conducted days before the Malibu crash. ABC's Diane Sawyer said during the broadcast that Jenner was unable to comment on the wreck but told ABC of the tragedy, "I was devastated."

Jenner escaped serious injury in the crash, having declined medical treatment at the scene, authorities said.

The accident remains under investigation by police.

Soul and R&B singer Ben E. King, famous for his deep, velvety baritone voice and the classic hit song "Stand by Me," died of natural causes in New Jersey at the age of 76, his representative said on Friday.

"He passed away on Thursday," said publicist Phil Brown, adding funeral arrangements would be announced within days.

King was born in North Carolina and moved to Harlem, New York, as a child. He began his career in the doo-wop group The Five Crowns, which later became The Drifters, before branching out as a solo artist.

"With an extremely heavy heart, I must say goodbye to one of the sweetest, gentlest and gifted souls that I have had the privilege of knowing and calling my friend for more than 50 year years, Mr Ben E. King," R&B singer Gary U.S. Bonds said on Facebook.
The Drifters had a string of hits with Atlantic Records and were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. King co-wrote and sang the lead on the group's first hit, "There Goes My Baby," in 1959.

He also was the lead vocalist with the group on songs such as "Save the Last Dance for Me," "This Magic Moment," "Dance With Me" and "I Count the Tears."

After a contractual dispute, King began a solo career in 1960 and recorded his best-known song, "Stand By Me," which was voted one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America. King, along with Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, wrote the 1961 hit.

The song, which is featured in and provided the title for the 1986 film "Stand by Me" by director Rob Reiner, was also inducted by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry. King had five No. 1 hits with The Drifters and as a solo artist.

King is survived by his wife, Betty, three children and six grandchildren.

A lesbian coming-out musical and a comedy about a teenager with an out-of-control, foul-mouthed sock puppet are proving that the off-kilter can kill it on Broadway and bring in a younger, edgier audience.

"Fun Home," adapted from lesbian cartoonist Alison Bechdel's graphic novel, led this week's Tony nominations with 12 nods, along with the post-World War Two musical "An American in Paris," showing the diversity and scope of Broadway productions.

Actor Steven Boyer's portrayal of a shy adolescent in a Christian Puppet Ministry in Texas, whose life is overshadowed by a demonic hand puppet in "Hand to God," could clinch a best acting award at the Tony Awards in New York on June 7.

"Every few years you get some new show that creates a different landscape. Think back to when 'Rent' came to Broadway," said Charlotte St. Martin, the executive director of The Broadway League, which represents producers and theater owners.

"This year 'Hand to God' and 'Fun Home' are bringing a new medium to theater," she added.

Along with the play "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time," a coming-of-age story about a teenager named Christopher Boone with Asperger syndrome, the shows are giving a voice to mainly unrepresented people in adventurous productions.

"I think it helps people understand autism more but it is also a story about bravery and difference and accepting differences and feeling excluded," said Alex Sharp, who plays Boone and will compete with Boyer for the best acting prize.

'HUNGER FOR MEANINGFUL WORK'

"Fun Home" broke new ground by being the first musical to feature a lesbian lead character, played by Beth Malone, a nominee for best actress in a musical. She comes to terms with her own sexuality and her relationship with her domineering father, a closeted gay man.

Tony nominee Sam Gold, the musical's director, says Broadway has always been a place where serious art is made, but he said about 10 years ago there was a shift toward more tourist-driven, lighter entertainment.

"It's been a hard economic landscape to make really deep and meaningful work in the last decade or so, and I think people are starting to hunger for meaningful work and we are starting to see that shifting back," he explained.

The risky shows are luring younger fans to Broadway, where nearly 80 percent of theatergoers were white, mostly women and had an average age of 44 during the 2013-2014 season, according to The Broadway League.

"There is no question that the diversity of the shows on Broadway, including the young, edgy ones are, bringing more young people to theater," said St. Martin.

Geneva Carr, nominated for a best actress Tony as Boyer's lonely mother in "Hand to God," has no doubt that the play that explores faith and morality by newcomer Robert Askins could be a game changer.

"This is a brand new American play by an unknown writer. I think other producers are going to take chances on plays they believe in and take risks, and that is what it is about," she said.

For William Ivey Long, the chair of the American Theatre Wing, which supports excellence in theater, and a Tony nominee for costume design for "On the Twentieth Century," it is all about pushing the envelope.

"Pushing what is able to be told and how it is able to be told is always important in the theater," he said. "One must always encourage these expressions, be they acceptable, outrageous, over-the-top, horrifying, chilling, all these things. We have some of each of that in the new shows this season."

Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon teams up with "Modern Family" star Sofia Vergara in "Hot Pursuit", a female-driven comedy directed, produced and led by a strong presence of women on set.

Academy Award winner Witherspoon, also one of the film's producers, plays an uptight police officer who has to protect the more outgoing widow of a drug boss, played by Colombian-born Vergara.-

"It's not just that it's better, you know? It's just that it's comfortable," Vergara said at the film's premiere on Thursday night, when asked about having more women involved in a production.

"We all were taking care of each other like 'Oh you need to sit straight because your dress is not looking good'. You know (with) things like that that (as) girls we're always like watching (out) for each other."

Witherspoon has been vocal about the empowerment of women in Hollywood. She has been quoted as saying she began her production company after she saw "six of my favorite actresses fighting over a really crappy role".

"It's an easier kind of communication working with just women," Witherspoon said at the premiere. "We have just a kind of a short hand. We think the same things are funny. It's also we just enjoy the process, it's fun.""Hot Pursuit" is scheduled for U.S. release on May 8.

Online music streaming service Grooveshark, admitting "very serious mistakes," shut down its operations as part of a settlement with major record labels, joining the ranks of several now-defunct peers sued over copyright infringement.

In a message posted to its website on Thursday, Grooveshark said that "despite (the) best of intentions, we made very serious mistakes. We failed to secure licenses from rights holders for the vast amount of music on the service."

The settlement ends a four-year legal battle and came as Grooveshark's parent company, Escape Media Group, was facing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in a trial set to begin in federal court in Manhattan on May 4.

Grooveshark will wipe clean all of the record companies' copyrighted works and hand over ownership of its website, mobile apps and intellectual property, including patents and copyrights, the company said.

Nine record companies, including Arista Music, Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings, and Warner Bros Records, sued Escape Media Group for infringement in 2011.

In court papers, they called Grooveshark a "linear descendant" of Grokster, LimeWire and Napster, all of which were shut down because of copyright infringement.

The labels on Friday referred to a statement by the Record Industry Association of America, which called the deal "an important victory for artists and the entire music industry."

The RIAA said that Escape founders Joshua Greenberg and Samuel Tarantino agreed to "significant financial penalties" if the terms of the settlement were breached. A spokesman for Grooveshark declined to comment.

Gainesville, Florida-based Grooveshark was thriving with more than 30 million users. The company said it had a policy to honor copyright holders' "takedown" requests that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa ruled last week that its infringement of nearly 5,000 recordings by artists such as Madonna, Jay-Z and Bob Marley was "willful" and made "in bad faith," potentially putting Escape on the hook for more than $736 million in damages.

Pop star Britney Spears has canceled two of her Las Vegas shows after injuring her ankle in a fall during a performance.

The "Toxic" and "Circus" singer took a tumble on Wednesday during one of her "Britney: Piece of Me" residency concerts at Las Vegas's Planet Hollywood resort and casino.

"Britney injured her ankle during her performance Wednesday evening and her doctor has advised her not to perform Friday and Saturday evening so that she may heal," Caesars Entertainment, which owns Planet Hollywood and resorts and casinos, said in a statement.

Spears, 33, told her fans on Twitter she would reschedule the May 1-2 shows.

The former child star and "X Factor" judge began a two-year residency in Las Vegas in December 2013.

The ex-fiance of actress Sofia Vergara, one of the stars of the hit ABC comedy "Modern Family", has defended his lawsuit seeking to take two frozen embryos the couple created before separating.

In a New York Times column published Wednesday, businessman Nick Loeb said that after the pair split in 2014, he sought to take the embryos to have them carried to term - assuming all financial and custodial responsibility - but she refused.

"When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?" he wrote.

Representatives for the Colombian-born Vergara, who last September earned the distinction of being the highest paid U.S. television actress for three consecutive years, could not be immediately reached for comment.

Loeb said he decided to write the op-ed after news of the case, which he filed in Santa Monica, California last August, recently broke in the media.

Son of former U.S. ambassador John L. Loeb Jr., Loeb said he and Vergara agreed to attempt in vitro fertilization and have a surrogate bear children from their embryos. He said the couple's first two attempts were unsuccessful, so they created two more embryos in 2013, both female.

Vergara's lawyer, Fred Silberberg, told People magazine in a statement earlier this month that she intended to keep the embryos frozen.

"Vergara, who has happily moved on with her life, is content to leave the embryos frozen indefinitely as she has no desire to have children with her ex, which should be understandable given the circumstances," he said in the statement.

In Wednesday's column, Loeb wrote the two had signed an agreement stipulating the embryos could only be used if both parties consented. He is seeking to have that form voided.

Loeb said he intends to move on and build a new family, but added: "That doesn't mean I should let the two lives I have already created be destroyed or sit in a freezer until the end of time."

"Hot Pursuit," a comedy starring Vergara and actress Reese Witherspoon is set to open next week.

Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss as the company spends heavily on restructuring and diversifying its business.

The company's selling and administrative expenses jumped 87 percent in the first quarter, mainly due to costs related to expansion of its AwesomenessTV business and marketing of a new television series.

Shares of DreamWorks, known for film franchises such as "Shrek", "Madagascar" and "Kung Fu Panda", fell about 5 percent to $24.70 in light extended trading on Thursday.

DreamWorks has been trying to diversify its business as it faces fierce competition from other studios such as Universal Pictures, the maker of "Despicable Me" series, and Warner Bros, the producer of "The Lego Movie".

The company's unit AwesomenessTV, a channel targeted at teens and young adults, inked a deal on Tuesday with Google Inc's YouTube to release feature films over the next two years. The first film under the deal is expected this fall.

DreamWorks, however, reported higher-than-expected revenue for the quarter ended March 31, helped by the successful release of "Home", its only film this year, and revenue from its "How to Train Your Dragon" franchise.

"Home", starring singer Rihanna and Emmy-award winning actor Jim Parsons, had one of the best openings for an original movie made by DreamWorks, pulling in $54 million in its opening weekend.

The film had grossed about $308 million worldwide as of April 30, DreamWorks said on Thursday.

Net loss attributable to DreamWorks widened to $54.8 million, or 64 cents per share, from $42.9 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 13 percent to $166.5 million.

Analysts on average had expected a loss of 45 cents per share and revenue of $164.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

DreamWorks took a pretax charge of $31.9 million related to job cuts, closure of its Redwood City studio in California and reduction in its annual movie slate to two from three.

Hollywood actress Jane Fonda reunites with her "Nine to Five" co-star Lily Tomlin in a new Netflix comedy about two jilted wives who have to start life over again in their seventies.

"Grace and Frankie" sees the two main characters forge a relationship after their husbands fall in love with each other.

The show's debut is timely in the United States, where the Supreme Court this week began hearing arguments in a landmark case that could pave the way to legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.

"We both have friends that are out and ... are dealing with this issue of same-sex marriage and so it seemed appropriate and timely that our series touches on that," Fonda said at the show's premiere on Wednesday night.

"For us it's about older women and how they handle massive turmoil and chaos and tragedy in a way in their lives when the rug is pulled out from under them ... They think they've been broken but they've been broken open and a new life looms ahead of them."

Fonda, 77, and Tomlin, 75, starred alongside singer Dolly Parton in the 1980 hit movie "Nine to Five".

On Tuesday, the court heard arguments concerning same-sex marriage restrictions imposed in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Both advocates and opponents rallied outside.

"It's amazing that we've dovetailed so well into the news," Tomlin said. "I don't think that anyone planned it."

The series, which comes from "Friends" creator Marta Kauffman, debuts on Netflix on May 8.

British pop singer Jessie J has upset her fans after she "unfollowed" hundreds of people on Twitter.

At the start of the month, the "Price Tag" singer was following 885 people on the micro-blogging site, where pop stars often have huge followings.

By Thursday her 'Following' count had gone down to just 1 but, confusingly, a further click brought up a message saying "@JessieJ isn't following anyone yet".

She began deleting the accounts she was following earlier this week, and fans quickly began to react angrily.

"I didn't unfollow just all my fans. Please stop trying to create bad energy, I unfollowed half my followers...," the singer wrote on Tuesday in a now deleted tweet.

"And when my thumb can be bothered I will unfollow the other half. Seriously guys. My love and respect for anyone isn't based in a follow."

Many of her supporters took to Twitter to voice their disappointment, with one writing: "@JessieJ your words upset so many people who got you here in the first place".

Another called the move "a punch in the face".

The 27-year old, whose "Bang Bang" collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande was a big hit last year, has 6.96 million followers.

"I'm sorry if I offended anyone. It's NEVER my intention," she has since written on her Twitter feed.

Pop stars Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber each follow tens of thousands of Twitter accounts.

Former Miss World contestant Ingrid Martens has swapped the catwalk and high heels for knee-high rough and unflattering golf shoes as a Ladies European Tour caddie but the Norwegian would not have it any other way.

There is precious little time for painted nails and lip gloss when she trudges across the fairways of the world carrying the heavy bag belonging to her daughter, 28-year-old Caroline.

"There's no mother-daughter relationship when we are out on the course," 49-year-old Ingrid told Reuters in an interview at the tour's Buckinghamshire Golf Club headquarters on the outskirts of London.

"When I am caddying she is the boss. It works very well, we never fight and she always takes the final decision on picking the right club to use.

"She ultimately makes the decisions after I give her the yardages but I don't tell her, for example, whether to use a seven-iron or an eight-iron."

Ingrid certainly does not hanker for the limelight having had her fair share of attention in the past working as a model and as a television game-show host.

"I was once Miss Norway and was in the Miss World competition in London in 1984," she said. "I didn't win and I probably wouldn't tell my kids to do what I did but it was a great experience.

"That's a tough life and I think you should focus on something else other than beauty and your body. I don't think that's a very healthy business...it's a bit of an artificial world.

"I also worked on TV as a game-show host for five years. I gained a lot of experience from that and from modelling in terms of being focused, trying to be strong, not being afraid and I think all that is very important," added Ingrid.

"I decided after five years I didn't want to have my face on screen any more. I wanted to be anonymous after being high profile in Norway for so long."

EIGHT-SHOT WIN

The highlight of Ingrid's part-time career as a caddie came when Caroline romped to an eight-shot victory at the tour's Qualifying School in Marrakech in 2013.

"I was a very proud mother that week," she said. "It was amazing and with about five holes to go I was crying.

"It was tough to hide. I was sniffing and made out I had a cold. After that I said I was never, ever going to caddie for her again because I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown.

"She didn't know she was winning by eight shots, she knew at the start that she was two behind the leader but on the way round she doesn't like to look at leaderboards," explained Ingrid.

"On the last hole she asked, 'Am I leading?, I said, 'Yes, you are'. Then she hit her second shot on to the green and that was another very emotional moment."

Caroline is still awaiting her first regular tour victory and is down in 31st position on this year's money list having earned the paltry sum of 11,756 euros ($12,776) from five tournaments.

Money is tight, the young Norwegian is searching for a sponsor and when she gets some financial support and hopefully climbs the rankings, it will signal the end of Ingrid's caddying career.

"I really enjoy it but I think she should have a professional caddie when she's good enough and I can then just walk around the course and watch," said Ingrid.

"If she gets on the LPGA Tour, for example, she will have to get a professional. I'm not going to move to the U.S. unless she pays me very, very well."

Caroline feels privileged to have her mum on the bag and dreams of qualifying to play for Europe in the Solheim Cup match, the women's version of the Ryder Cup, against the United States in Germany in September.

"We are very close and I feel stronger when she's around," said Caroline. "She's not with me every week but when she is I enjoy it a lot.

"I don't know if I can get into the Solheim Cup this year but if I do get in she will be on the bag for sure. That will be my reward to her.

"It would be amazing. I get goosebumps just thinking about it. That's a dream of mine."

First jobs are not usually very funny.

In fact they're often menial, and low-paid, and pretty degrading. But that's exactly why some of the country's top comedians find such a wealth of comic material there.

For the latest in Reuters' monthly First Jobs series, we talked to comedians about the first time they brought home paychecks. The inevitable lesson: From tragedy comes comedy.

Tom Green

First job: Dairy Queen counter

"I was 15 and just wanted to skateboard all the time. But my father was an army man, and it was important to him that I had a job. If I didn't have one, he would wake me up at 6:30, turn the lights and the radio on, make me get in the car and drop me at the student employment center.

"A lot of those jobs were telemarketing, like booking heating-duct inspections. I had to scare people into thinking their ducts were full of mites. I would do my minimum requirement and then just make prank calls the rest of the day.

"Eventually, I ended up working at a Dairy Queen, where I got really good at making Peanut Buster Parfaits. I used to put extra fudge on it. If you ever want a great one, just put me behind the counter.

"I made $3.75 an hour and worked there almost two years. It was really embarrassing because kids from high school would come by and I'd be there in my little Dairy Queen uniform. It's very hard to be cool when there's a girl you have a crush on, and you're selling her a Dilly Bar."

Kathleen Madigan

First job: Holiday Inn room service

"This was in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, which is a summer touristy place, but if you lived there full-time they gave you a job at almost any age. I was only 15 and lied that I was older, and started working in the Holiday Inn restaurant as a room-service attendant.

"It was ludicrous. I was 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, carrying all these giant trays around. I don't know how I did it. But the best part was that after you delivered the food, you could smoke a cigarette or slam a beer on the way back.

"I made $2.01 an hour plus tips, which was crazy money for a kid. I thought it was the greatest job on earth. Why didn't everyone do this?

"Once I delivered room service to Dolly Parton, and almost shit my pants. I couldn't believe someone that famous was in Lake of the Ozarks. At first I thought maybe it was her sibling or something, but then I read the bill she signed, and it was really her. I couldn't even say anything. She must have thought I was a frozen paralyzed mutant, or some borderline case.

"I still go to that lake every summer, and drive by that place and think, 'Wow, I worked there once.' But if I opened a door and saw Dolly Parton right now, I'd still shit my pants today."

Wyatt Cenac

First job: Locking doors

"When I was 12 years old in Dallas, we lived on a street where a lot of new houses were being built, and the developer paid me a few bucks to lock up houses at the end of the night. I guess realtors would be coming through, and at the end of the day everything was still unlocked. I don't think that happens much anymore.

"Not only did I have to lock up, but I had to walk around and make sure nobody was in there, even checking all the closets. I don't know why my family let me do that by myself. It seems like a good way to set a child up to get murdered.

"As soon as it got dark outside, things got really creepy. Some of the houses didn't even have lights yet, and there I was walking around all these dark empty homes. After a while I got really paranoid. Here's the life lesson I learned: There are certain things you don't make a 12-year-old do, and locking up empty homes at night is one of those things.

"I don't know what kind of world I was living in at the time, where everyone left houses unlocked and then paid a kid money to put his life at risk."

Nigerian artists spanning five decades of music-making took honors in Songlines magazine's 2015 awards, with Afrobeat pioneer and drummer Tony Allen winning Best Artist and Ibibio Sound Machine picked as Best Newcomers.

The Malian father and son duo of Toumani Sidiki Diabate were named Best Group for their work highlighting the griot (story teller) tradition in the awards, announced on Thursday.

The Kronos Quartet, usually associated with classical music, took the Cross-Cultural Collaboration award for an album embracing the music of countries ranging from Syria to China.

Allen, 74, was nominated for his "Film of Life" album but the award was as much a recognition of his lifetime achievements, Songlines editor-in-chief Simon Broughton said.

Allen began working with the late Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti in 1964 and helped create the Afrobeat style which energized the continent. Once described as the "finest drummer on the planet", his music blends jazz, funk and tribal grooves.

"As Fela said, without Tony Allen, there wouldn't be any Afrobeat. Fela very much handed the invention of Afrobeat over to him as a moving force," Broughton told Reuters.

"Film of Life," which features a collaboration with Blur's Damon Albarn, showed him still fresh and eager to experiment.

It also deals with topical issues. Two tracks, "Go Back" and "Boat Journey", with its refrain of "Don't take the boat journey", highlight the plight of Africans fleeing from war and poverty only to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean.

The London-based Ibibio Sound Machine, fronted by charismatic singer Eno Williams, are a group of young Nigerian expatriates who weave the folk tales of southeast Ibibio region with electronic grooves, funk, Afrobeat and Highlife.

"They are really making an impact. It's that nice mixture of Nigerian but in a London context. London is probably the World Music capital of the world right now," Broughton said.

Sidiki Diabate is better known as a rapper but he linked up with his father, griot and kora player Toumani, for an eponymous album of songs in a traditional vein.

"The Diabate family has been absolutely central to Malian music for years and years, generations and generations. Toumani's father was a leading kora player. They are very much looking back at the tradition they have inherited and expressing the idea of passing it on," Broughton said.

The Diabates also address the refugee tragedy - their song "Lampedusa" references the Italian island which has offered shelter to shipwrecked and stranded migrants.

Although The Kronos Quartet usually works with contemporary composers, its album "A Thousand Thoughts" draws on music from countries as diverse as Iran, Syria, China, Vietnam and Ethiopia and features guest artists such as Le Mystere des Voix Bulgare women's choir and Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain.

Elvis Presley is back in the building, returning to the Las Vegas hotel where he performed more than 600 times, in a new permanent exhibition about his life.

"Graceland Presents ELVIS: The Exhibition", which opened last week, features more than 300 artifacts never before displayed outside of his Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee.

The display looks at his early days as a recording artist, his stint in the U.S. army, his films and shows.

The singer began a Las Vegas performance residency in 1969 that went on to break box office attendance for the city.

"Elvis is synonymous with the city of Las Vegas, and now he is back on the ground," Graceland's director of communications Kevin Kern told Reuters in Los Angeles.

Presley's widow, Priscilla, and daughter Lisa Marie cut the ribbon at the exhibition's opening at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino, previously known as the International Hotel, where the singer performed between 1969 and 1976.

"This is where his home was, he loved coming here," Priscilla said. "He was very fond of Vegas and I think that, if not touring, still coming to Vegas (is) what he loved best."

Among the items displayed is a jewel-studded belt, with the word "Elvis" spelled out in diamonds, that he was given by the hotel.

"Elvis broke all box office records in Las Vegas in terms of attendance and really set the stage for a revolution for live entertainment in Las Vegas," Kern said.

The "Aloha from Hawaii" cape that Elvis wore on stage in Las Vegas, a replica of the cape he wore at a special show in Hawaii in 1973, is also on display. The white cape is adorned with an eagle and stars.

Superheroes Thor and Captain America might be serious about saving the world in Marvel's ensemble "Avengers: Age of Ultron," but actors Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans found themselves unable to keep a straight face while discussing the film.

Amid laughs and irreverence in an interview with Reuters, Hemsworth, the 31-year-old who plays Thor, and Evans, 33, who stars in the role of Captain America, talked about the Marvel franchise and female characters. Here are excerpts.

Q: The Avengers are looking inwards at their own fears and responsibilities in "Age of Ultron." Why was that important?

Hemsworth: They're a little more mature than the first time around. The first time was them trying to come together as a team, and now they're trying to operate as a larger scale, as a team, or have been for some time.

But I think all the worlds that they've been a part of are beginning to collide, and the pieces of the puzzle that they've moved around are coming together and causing this chaotic event.

Q: There has been a lot of commentary that there needs to be more female representation in these films.

Evans: Who says that? Great, use that. Nailed it. Man, I saved this one.

Hemsworth: I didn't say that, by the way.

Evans: No, I did.

Hemsworth: I agree, there should be more female representation ... (laughing) Before he (Evans) ruins this interview and my career, what's the question? I'm actually interested, what was the question?

Q: How does this movie address criticism that there aren't enough female characters in superhero movies?

Hemsworth: (If I) have it my way, I'd get rid of all of us, have an all female cast - women are smarter than men. My mum's smarter, so is my wife, so women (turns to Evans) you should leave this interview and women should lead the world. You sexist human being.

Evans: This interview is my favorite one. This is my favorite one. My favorite.

Hemsworth: I'm with you though, I'm just not sure we've really nailed down the question.

Evans: But they're going to do it though. They're doing "Captain Marvel," people are going nuts over Captain Marvel.

Scarlett (Johansson) was playing Black Widow in "Iron Man 2," it wasn't like she had a long-picture deal, but fans wanted it and she keeps coming back. Now we've got (Elizabeth) Olsen and even Cobie (Smulders), they keep bringing Cobie back.

There's no denying that people want to see female superheroes and there's plenty of them, and I think (with) Marvel, these aren't getting old. I think a lot of people think there's superhero exhaustion. I tend to disagree because Marvel can't stop making good movies, and they absolutely will bring more females to the screen. Nailed it.

Q: You answered two of our questions in one go.

Evans: I don't even have a wife!

Southern rockers Alabama Shakes scored their first chart-topping album on the weekly U.S. Billboard 200 chart on Wednesday.

"Sound & Color," the second album by the band, sold 91,000 albums, 27,000 songs and was streamed 3.6 million times, totaling 96,000 units according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan.

The album's success comes after the band was one of the standouts from the annual Coachella 3-day music festival in Southern California earlier this month.

The soundtrack to Universal Pictures' April blockbuster "Furious 7" held its spot at No. 2, selling 62,000 units, while rapper Yelawolf's new album "Love Story" debuted at No. 3 with 58,000 units.

The Billboard 200 chart tallies album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).

No other new entries cracked into the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart this week, and last week's chart-topper, Shawn Mendes' "Handwritten," dropped to No. 17.

On the Digital Songs charts, which measures online download sales, Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's "See You Again," the tribute to late actor Paul Walker on the "Furious 7" soundtrack, held steady at No. 1 with 316,000 downloads sold last week.

British crime writer Ruth Rendell, best known as the creator of Detective Chief Inspector Wexford, died in hospital on Saturday at the age of 85, her publisher said.

Rendell, the author of more than 60 best-selling novels, had suffered a severe stroke in January.

"We are devastated by the loss of one of our best loved authors, Ruth Rendell. Our thoughts are with her family," Penguin Random House UK said in a statement.

Rendell's first novel, "From Doon With Death", was published in 1964 and she since wrote several award-winning books, including "A Demon in My View" in 1976 and "Live Flesh" 10 years later. Last year, she published "The Girl Next Door".

Rendell's works, some written under the pen name Barbara Vine, have been published in some 30 countries and many have been adapted for television and film.

In 1997, she took the title Baroness Rendell of Babergh after being named to the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, for the opposition Labour Party.

“Ruth Rendell was an outstanding and hugely popular figure in British literature and, for the last 18 years, served the Labour Party in the House of Lords with great loyalty and passion," Labour leader Ed Miliband said on Saturday.

Olympic champion and reality television star Bruce Jenner was sued for negligence and wrongful death on Friday by relatives of a woman killed in a car crash involving the former athlete on a Southern California highway in February.

The complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by two stepchildren of Kimberly Howe, who died in the Feb. 7 collision on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that sheriff's deputies said had left five other people injured.

The lawsuit claims Jenner was driving his Cadillac Escalade, towing a trailer with an off-road vehicle, when he struck Howe's car from the rear, propelling her automobile into oncoming traffic, and she collided head-on with another vehicle.

According to the suit, Jenner "violated the rules of the road" and was "negligent, careless and reckless" in causing the wreck, though the six-page complaint did not specify how Jenner was alleged to have been at fault. By contrast, Howe was "acting with due caution, attention and care" and did not contribute to the crash, the suit said.
Jenner's publicist, Alan Nierob, declined comment on the case.

The wrongful death claim seeks unspecified damages for the personal loss of Howe and her financial support to her stepdaughter, Dana Redmond, and stepson William Howe.

Kimberly Howe's obituary said she and her deceased husband of 32 years ran a national health food business, and that she previously played bit parts in several Elvis Presley movies.

The suit came one week after Jenner declared in a nationally televised interview that he identifies as a woman, becoming the most high-profile American to come out as transgender. Nierob, however, has said Jenner still prefers to be referred to with male pronouns.

Jenner, 65, rose to fame with a record-breaking Olympic gold medal victory in the decathalon in the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal that earned him the unofficial title of "World's Greatest Athlete."

Known to younger generations as the patriarch of reality TV's Kardashian clan, Jenner appeared on ABC's "20/20" last Friday to put to rest months of speculation that he was transitioning to life as a woman.

The interview was conducted days before the Malibu crash. ABC's Diane Sawyer said during the broadcast that Jenner was unable to comment on the wreck but told ABC of the tragedy, "I was devastated."

Jenner escaped serious injury in the crash, having declined medical treatment at the scene, authorities said.

The accident remains under investigation by police.

Veteran blues guitarist B.B. King said Friday he was in hospice care at his home, less than a month after he was hospitalized for diabetes-related issues.

In a message posted on his official Facebook page, the 89-year-old singer said he was receiving care at his Las Vegas residence.

"Thanks to all for your well wishes and prayers," he said in the post.

King was taken to a hospital in April after suffering from dehydration as a complication of diabetes. He left shortly after and said he was "feeling much better" at the time.

Born in Mississippi, the singer is known as the "King of the Blues" and is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time, with artists such as Eric Clapton citing him as an influence.

Last October, King was forced to cancel eight live performances after falling ill on stage in Chicago. He was diagnosed with dehydration and suffering from exhaustion.

The rebooted "Star Wars" franchise hit a bump on Friday as filmmaker Josh Trank, who was selected to direct one of the upcoming standalone films, said he was stepping down from the project to pursue other "creative opportunities."

Trank, 30, the director of 2012's sci-fi movie "Chronicle" and the upcoming "Fantastic Four" movie, was selected to direct the second "Star Wars Anthology" due out in 2018. The three anthology films will intersect a new trilogy in the franchise, kicking off with "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in December.

"After a year of having the incredible honour of developing with the wonderful and talented people at Lucasfilm, I'm making a personal decision to move forward on a different path," Trank said in a statement on StarWars.com.

"I've put a tremendous amount of thought into this, and I know deep down in my heart that I want to pursue some original creative opportunities."

Lucasfilm's vice president of development, Kiri Hart, added, "We are grateful for the energy and love of Star Wars that he brought to the process."

No replacement for Trank has been named yet.

"The Force Awakens," directed by J.J. Abrams, is the first of a new "Star Wars" trilogy being produced by Walt Disney Co since it purchased the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.05 billion. It is expected to be one of the biggest box office hits later this year, and its two trailers have already amassed millions of views amid frenzied fan interest.

"Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One," directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Felicity Jones, is the first of the standalone films and is due out in 2016.

"Star Wars," created by filmmaker George Lucas, grossed more than $4.4 billion at the worldwide box office since 1977 with six films and has become embedded in pop culture, spawning a legion of devoted fans.

Franchise stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will all return in "The Force Awakens."

Two more women, a writer and an actress, on Friday said comedian Bill Cosby had sexually assaulted them decades ago, bringing the list of his accusers to more than 40.

Actress Lili Bernard and writer Sammie Mays made the allegations against the comedian at a news conference with prominent lawyer Gloria Allred the day before the last show of Cosby's national comedy tour in Atlanta.

Cosby, best known for his role as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the hit TV series "The Cosby Show," has never been charged over any of the allegations. The 77-year-old settled a 2005 civil lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct.

His representative did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has previously dismissed similar allegations by other women as "discredited" and "defamatory."

Bernard said Cosby drugged, raped and threatened her while he helped her prepare for a role in the 1984-1992 show's last season.

"After he had won my complete trust and admiration, he drugged and raped me," said the mother of six.

Bernard said she told her agent, family, several friends and her pastor about the attack. She later became suicidal and was hospitalized.

"I still suffer panic attacks and night terrors as a result of what Mr. Cosby did to me," she said. "I stand here to take back my power and confront the fear that has paralyzed me for so many years."

Bernard and Allred said they went to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where one of the alleged attacks occurred, on Thursday to report it to the police. New Jersey has no statute of limitations for rape.

The Atlantic City Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Sammie Mays said she was a writer at a television convention in New Orleans in 1986 when Cosby agreed to an interview. After accompanying him to his hotel room and accepting a drink, she said she woke up confused and partially undressed as Cosby stared down at her. She said she quickly tried to compose herself, then left.

"Once in the lobby, I realized I had just survived an

encounter with a scheming madman who hid his demons behind an alluring personality," she said.

Allred, who represents many of Cosby's accusers, said she will join a planned protest on Saturday at the Atlanta theater where Cosby is scheduled to perform.

"Avengers: Age of Ultron" scored the second-biggest domestic opening in history this weekend, kicking off summer blockbuster season with a mammoth $187.7 million debut.

Globally, the film is a juggernaut, pulling in an estimated $627 million in 12 days of release. At that pace, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" should pass $1 billion, particularly after it opens in China on May 12.

One record remained tantalizingly out of grasp for Captain America, Iron Man and company, however. Going into the weekend many analysts predicted that "Avengers: Age of Ultron" would top the $207.4 million haul posted in 2012 by the first film in the super-team series. That box office high-water mark will stand... at least until "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" lands in theaters this Christmas.

Part of the issue may have been weaker reviews than the first "Avengers" film, as well as competition from the NBA playoffs, the Kentucky Derby and the hotly anticipated boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao.

The "Avengers: Age of Ultron" results are still an astonishing feat and a testament to the powerful sway that Disney and Marvel have over moviegoers around the world. The three biggest North American debuts in history are now all Marvel movies, with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" displacing "Iron Man 3" and its $174.1 million opening from its runner-up perch on the all-time list.

"It would be a shame to see headlines saying 'Avengers 2' fails by not setting opening weekend records," said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. "This is still a massive debut, but there's something about the movie industry where people feel every weekend should set a new record."

Roughly $18 million of "Avengers'" opening weekend loot came from 364 Imax screens, while premium large format screens scored a record $13.5 million haul. The film played broadly across demographic categories. Roughly 59% of the audience was male, 41% was 25 years and older, 12% were teenagers and 22% were families. "Avengers: Age of Ultron" carries $250 million in production costs and screened in 4,276 North American locations.

Earth's Mightiest Heroes didn't leave much left over for other films in the marketplace. A vast chasm exists between the first and second place finishers on the domestic charts, with "Age of Adaline" clocking in behind "Avengers: Age of Ultron" with $6.3 million, bringing Lionsgate's romantic fantasy's total to $23.4 million.

Universal's "Furious 7" nabbed third place with $6.1 million, bringing its stateside plunder to $330.5 million. The action sequel is now the fourth highest-grossing film of all time on a worldwide basis with $1.4 billion in tickets sold.

Fourth place went to Sony's "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" at roughly $5.4 million, bringing its domestic score to $51 million, while DreamWorks Animation's "Home" came in fifth with $3.3 million pushing its total to $158.1 million.

In limited release, Fox Searchlight's "Far From the Madding Crowd" grossed $172,000 from five markets over in its opening weekend for a per screen average of $17,200. The indie label will add 19 new markets next weekend and plans to get to approximately 95 theaters by the Mother's Day weekend. Fox Searchlight used the same weekend last year to launch "Belle," another art house film pegged at older, affluent female crowds.

"It's a classic, beautifully shot period piece and we feel that it's a film that will work perfectly for Mother's Day," said Frank Rodriguez, senior vice president of distribution at Fox Searchlight.

The overall box office topped out at $227 million thanks largely to the costumed heroes. That represented a sizable 47.3% increase over the same weekend last year when "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" bowed to $91.6 million.

"The Hunger Games" actress Elizabeth Banks makes her debut as a feature film director in the musical comedy "Pitch Perfect 2" and hopes to inspire more women to get behind the camera.

Banks also appears in the sequel to the 2012 "Pitch Perfect" box office hit about a girls college singing group. The new film stars U.S. actresses Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld and Australian Rebel Wilson.

Several actresses have blasted sexism in Hollywood. In a recent interview, "Twilight" star Kristen Stewart said the industry was "disgustingly sexist", adding women had "to work a little bit harder to be heard."

"I actually felt a lot of support. I felt there was a lot of people rooting for the movie to work ... I'm really proud of the product," Banks said during a promotional interview in London.

"I think just because it's rare doesn't mean that it's a particularly difficult or hard job to do ... Boys do it all the time. I hope really that what I've done inspires other women to get behind the camera and to tell more of these stories."

Banks, who plays Effie Trinket in "The Hunger Games" franchise, has previously directed short films but "Pitch Perfect 2", in which she reprises the role of Gail, is her first time in the director's chair for a major feature film

Wilson, who stole the show in the original film as Fat Amy, is back as the boisterous member of the Barden Bellas group. The actress has also played roles in female-led comedies "Bridesmaids" and "Bachelorette".

"When I was growing up, I watched a lot of movies obviously starring guys, comedy movies, and the female character would just be the straight pretty one," she said.

"But now you have these kind of ensemble female movies like 'Bridesmaids' (which) really kicked off a whole new wave of it, where girls are just really rocking out and being hilarious."

"Pitch Perfect 2" will be released on May 15.

British band Blur hit the top of the UK album chart on Sunday with "The Magic Whip", the group's first number one album in 12 years, the Official Charts Company said.

Nearly 24 years since their debut album, Blur saw off Taylor Swift's "1989" and James Bay's "Chaos and the Calm", which placed second and third respectively. Former number one "Stages" by Josh Groban charted in fourth, ahead of "Title" by Meghan Trainor.

In the singles chart, Felix Jaehn's remix of "Cheerleader" by Omi overtook "See you Again" by Wiz Khalifa to win the top spot, after a tight race decided by just over 1,000 total sales.

New entry "I Really Like You" by Carly Rae Jepsen charted in third position, with "Lean On" by Major Lazer in fourth and "Hold my Hand" by Jess Glynne at number five.

Major retailers and Disney Stores around the world will start selling the first merchandise tied to the upcoming film "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" during an event that will kick off just after midnight on Sept. 4.

Walt Disney Co announced the plans on Sunday, just ahead of May the Fourth, an unofficial holiday known among fans as Star Wars Day.

Demand for "Star Wars" merchandise is expected to jump with the Dec. 18 release of "The Force Awakens," the first movie in 10 years from the celebrated sci-fi franchise, Wall Street analysts say.

At the Sept. 4 event, Disney stores and other retailers will open at 12:01 a.m. to sell products ranging from toys, books, and collectibles to comics, e-books, apps, apparel and lifestyle accessories, Disney said in a statement. New products will also be sold online at Disneystore.com.

The company urged fans to document their Sept. 4 shopping experiences on social media with hashtags #ForceFriday and #MidnightMadness. It also unveiled new product packaging that features Kylo Ren, a masked villain from "The Force Awakens."

Disney bought "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in 2012.

Maya Plisetskaya, a star of Russia's Bolshoi ballet who overcame a legacy of Stalinist oppression to redefine her art and be feted as the greatest ballerina of her generation, has died in Germany aged 89.

Plisetskaya died of a heart attack in Munich, Russian media reported on Saturday evening, citing the director of the Bolshoi theater Vladimir Urin. Her death was "a huge loss not only for Russian culture, but also for the whole world of ballet", he told RIA news agency.

Plisetskaya had lived since 1991 in Munich, where she moved with her husband, composer Rodion Shedrin, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In a career spanning six decades, she gained international fame for a fiery, emotional style that contrasted with the more demure performances traditionally expected of ballerinas.

Under Joseph Stalin her family were branded "enemies of the people", her father falling victim in 1938 to one of the regime's bloody purges while her mother was sentenced to several years in a labor camp.

Plisetskaya was also disadvantaged by growing up Jewish at a time in the late 1940s and early 1950s when the Soviet leader was gripped with paranoia about imaginary 'Zionist' plots.

"Endless suffering and humiliation fill my memory," she wrote in her 2001 autobiography.

"What drove her past all obstacles and hazards were her unbending determination and her refusal to do things any way but her own," dance critic Robert Gottlieb wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2001.

Plisetskaya was born in Moscow in 1925, spending part of her childhood in a Russian mining colony run by her engineer father on the barren Norwegian Arctic island of Spitsbergen.

She appears to have inherited her artistic talents from her mother's side. Her mother Rachel Messerer-Plisetskaya was a silent movie star while an aunt and uncle both danced for the Bolshoi.

Studying at the famous Moscow ballet school from the age of nine, she first danced for the Bolshoi at 11, joining it permanently in 1943 and becoming its lead ballerina in 1960.

Fearing that she might defect to the West, Soviet authorities banned Plisetskaya from traveling abroad until 1959, when Nikita Khrushchev lifted the travel ban in response to her growing popularity.

Khrushchev, who had rehabilitated Plisetskaya's parents along with thousands of other victims of Stalin, described her as "not only as the best ballerina in the Soviet Union, but the best in the world".

She joined a celebrated 1959 Bolshoi tour of the United States and Canada, performing as Odette-Odile in Tchaikovsky's masterpiece "Swan Lake", her signature role and which she later said she prepared for by studying the movements of actual swans in the park.

Plisetskaya stayed with the Bolshoi until her retirement in 1990, directing and teaching as well as dancing.

President Vladimir Putin expressed "deep, sincere condolences" at her death, the Kremlin said, while Boris Akimov, a star of the 1960s and 1970s who danced with Plisetskaya, told news agency Tass: "She was a ballerina from God."

With security beefed up at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the rich and famous settled into their expensive seats shortly before the welterweight showdown between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao began on Saturday.

Tickets for a hotly anticipated megabout dubbed the "Fight of the Century" have been coveted by A-listers and high-rollers, with no guarantee that prime front row spots would be granted for every request from the biggest names in show business.

Around 900 ringside seats were available for the celebrities, business tycoons and entertainment moguls who have converged on Las Vegas, and actors Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck were among those who secured the prized positions.

Tennis greats Andre Agassi and his wife, Steffi Graf, were also in the front rows, squeezed in alongside boxing great Sugar Ray Leonard, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Hollywood stars Christian Bale and Michael Keating.

Other high-profile fans watching ringside, where seats have demanded up to $350,000 on the resale site StubHub, included former heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield and retired NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller.

Also making their way into the Arena via the red carpet were American actors Bradley Cooper, Mark Wahlberg, Denzel Washington and Claire Danes, Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook and English musician Sting.

The atmosphere in the heavily secured 16,800-seat Garden Arena was electric as the two fighters prepared to make their way to the ring for a bout that is expected to be the biggest grossing of all time with a 'Who's Who' of society looking on.

However, not every A-lister ended up close to the action with some of them bumped into the upper seating levels.

"They can't all sit in the front row," said Dena duBoef of Top Rank promotions, who represent Pacquiao. "Tickets and seating have probably been the biggest nightmare for this fight."

Fewer than 1,000 tickets for the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout were offered to the public, and those were snapped up in seconds.

The remainder was divided among the two fighters' promotion companies and MGM Resorts, which made seats available to their best customers -- gamblers who carry a minimum $250,000 credit line in the casino.

"It's very disappointing that so few tickets were available to the fans," Pacquiao fan Raymond Avenido from Hermosa Beach, California told Reuters.

"It would have been nice to have had a bigger venue, and make the tickets affordable for those of us who are not high-paying customers.

"As a boxing fan, I would have paid between $500 and $800. That should be the ceiling for someone who has been following Manny Pacquiao since he was still boxing in the Philippines."

Music streaming service Spotify is laying plans to enter the Web video business and has been in discussions with several digital media players about potential partnerships, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The company has been reaching out to companies that specialize in making content for Google Inc's YouTube to discuss both acquiring their material and co-creating original video series, the Journal said.

Spotify could announce its video plans as early as this month, the report said.

Spotify declined to comment.

The company is nearing a deal to raise $400 million, valuing it at $8.4 billion, the Wall Street Journal had reported last month.

Spotify, which competes with Pandora Media Inc and Apple Inc's Beats, said in January it had 15 million subscribers and 60 million active users at the end of 2014.

Among the jubilant crowds celebrating the end of World War Two, two young princesses mingled and danced incognito on the streets of London.

Slipping out of Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth and Margaret danced a conga in the swanky Ritz hotel, mixed anonymously among the crowds in central Piccadilly and cheered their parents from outside the palace gates at midnight.

Or so tells a new film about Britain's Queen Elizabeth and her late younger sister Margaret and what they might have done on the night of May 8, 1945.

Their cousin Margaret Rhodes has been quoted in British media as saying King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth allowed the then 19- and 14-year old princesses to leave the palace, but little is known of how they spent the night.

"A Royal Night Out" imagines just what could have happened.

"It's very much a fantasy ... I think the lightness and the comedic moments of the film really juxtapose the drama and intensity of that moment in time in the post-war era," Sarah Gadon, who plays Princess Elizabeth, said in a promotional interview.

"(There is) a good balance for us to tell this story."

The film stars British actors Rupert Everett as the king, Emily Watson as his wife and Bel Powley as Princess Margaret.

Canadian Gadon, who has previously put on a British accent for "A Dangerous Method" and "Belle", trained with a dialect coach for the film.

"I think when you're going to play such a recognizable figure in the hearts of British people you don't want to mess up the accent," she said.

"If you can't convince people of that then you're lost from the start. So we spent a lot of time focusing on that."

"A Royal Night Out" is released in UK cinemas on May 15.

On a fairground set and with a wardrobe of glittering gowns, Mariah Carey opened her Las Vegas residency, hitting many of the high notes she is famous for.

One of the best-selling women solo artists of the last two decades, Carey is performing her 18 No.1 hits in "Mariah #1 to Infinity" at The Colosseum at Caesar's Palace.

The Grammy Award winner, known for songs such as "Hero" and "When You Believe", displayed her multi-octave range as she performed on a fairground set complete with a merry-go-round, roller coaster and ferris wheel.

As her shimmering dresses changed throughout the show on Wednesday night so did the set, which was adorned towards the end of the show with chandeliers and butterfly patterns.

The 45-year-old pop star received a standing ovation from the audience at end of the show, which runs until July 26.

Among other stars performing at Caesars Palace later this year are Celine Dion, Elton John and Rod Stewart.

Jackie Chan was named Singapore's first celebrity anti-drug ambassador on Thursday and the kung fu movie star sought to warn the city state's youth off illegal substances as he spoke of his son's drug crimes.

The Hong Kong actor's son, Jaycee Chan, was released from a Chinese jail in February after serving a six-month sentence on drugs charges.

He had been formally charged last year with "the crime of sheltering others to take drugs" after testing positive for marijuana and police saying they had found 100 grams of the drug at his Beijing home.

"I would never think it would happen to my family. The day I found out, I am so ashamed, I am so angry. How (did) that happen?" Chan said. "I was very angry but it made me more determined to be against drugs."

Chan, named an anti-drug ambassador by Beijing in 2009, sought to deter youths who had gathered to see him at the Singapore event from involvement with drugs.

"Don't ever think you won't get addicted, because not only are you hurting yourself ... your one drug addiction will hurt your family," the actor said.

"In order to earn money, you'll steal, you'll rob. In the end, you're hurting your country, you're hurting your family, you're hurting your son ... it's a domino effect."

The younger Chan, a 32-year-old actor and singer, apologized for his actions upon his release. The use of ketamine and methamphetamine has increased in China in recent years and Beijing continues to heavily prosecute marijuana use.

Tripping on muscle relaxants and peyote on the beach, two discarded wives portrayed by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin work through their anger and heartbreak and then ask "now what?"

How an uptight Grace (Fonda) and a bohemian Frankie (Tomlin) bounce back from the indignity of abandonment by their husbands at an advanced age is the comic fodder for the new Netflix Inc series "Grace and Frankie" that debuts Friday with 13 episodes available for streaming.

Enjoying an easy rapport 35 years after the two teamed up with Dolly Parton in working women revenge comedy "9 to 5," Fonda, 77, and Tomlin, 75, revel in the rare opportunity to showcase women of a certain age.

"We are the fastest growing demographic in the world and yet we are not reflected in the media," said Fonda, a two-time Oscar winner in her first lead television role.

"I am really happy about the fact that 'Grace and Frankie' can begin to expose what it is really like to be older women."

Grace and Frankie are a modern-day odd couple, thrown together by their husbands' revelation that they are a gay couple and wish to marry. Martin Sheen plays Grace's husband of 40 years, Robert, and Sam Waterston is Frankie's spouse, Sol.

With the physical comedy that made famous her sketch characters Ernestine (the nosy telephone operator) and Edith Ann (the precocious girl), Tomlin is a quirky spiritualist that goes on vision quests, brews peyote tea and chants like a mooing cow.

YAMS AND JAM

Tomlin, a six-time Emmy winner, said Grace and Frankie show women "are not full of old cliches and stereotypes and we become people!"

The two actresses, among the most celebrated of their generation, sound miffed when they talk about the dearth of roles for women their age. But then they crack a joke and make each other cackle.

Like their characters, they don't hold back on graphic language and details about dealing with an aging body, such as when Grace goes to bed with a new boyfriend.

"Frankie is concerned about vaginal dryness being a problem," Fonda said. "So she gives me her vaginal lubricant that she has made from yams and I thought it was jam and have been putting it on my toast."

"It's good for you," responded Tomlin.

"That's what you tell me ... don't put anything in your vagina that you wouldn't put in your mouth," Fonda retorted.

Hot Chocolate lead singer Errol Brown has died at the age of 71 after suffering from liver cancer, his manager said on Wednesday.

Hot Chocolate was known for hits such as "Emma," "Every 1's a Winner" and "You Sexy Thing."

The singer passed away at his home in The Bahamas, with his wife Ginette and daughters Colette and Leonie by his side, manager Phil Dale said, describing him as a "gentle man."

"Errol was a lover of life and obviously 'music!'. I never went into his home, car or a hotel room without music playing," Dale said in a statement. "And it always played constantly in his dressing room before a concert."

Brown was made MBE (Member of the British Empire) by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2003 for his services to popular music. A year later, he received an Ivor Novello award for outstanding contribution to British music.

"You Sexy Thing" was first released in the 1970s and featured in the 1997 British film "The Full Monty" about six unemployed men who form a striptease act.

The man accused of breaking into Oscar-winning actress Sandra Bullock's Los Angeles home entered a not guilty plea to more than two dozen charges in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday. 

Joshua Corbett was charged with stalking, first-degree burglary, possession of a machine gun and possession of an assault weapon, among other things. He remained silent as his attorneys entered his plea.

The judge set a pre-trial hearing for June 8.

Police found an arsenal of weapons at Corbett's Montrose, California, home following his arrest at Bullock's Beverly Hills residence in June last year.

Bullock was at home during the alleged break-in and locked herself in her bedroom closet, from where she called the police and waited until they arrived.

Bullock's frantic and fearful 911 emergency call was played during a preliminary hearing in court last month.

Corbett's attorney Steve Sitkoff on Wednesday said his client "really thought he was married" to Bullock, and added, "it was a delusion, but he doesn't think that anymore."

"He's mentally disturbed. He's getting some help in jail, but he's not getting the kind of help he can get," Sitkoff said following the arraignment. 

"(Corbett) never intended to hurt Miss Bullock and we're going to show that."

Corbett is being held on bail. He faces more than 20 years in state prison if convicted as charged.

Kristin Chenoweth, star of the Broadway musical "On the Twentieth Century," will juggle two roles during the Tony Awards as a co-host and a nervous nominee for theater's biggest honors but what she wants most is for her show to win this year.

Chenoweth, 46, won a Tony in 1999 for her role in the musical "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" but has never been in a Tony-winning show in her nearly 20-year career on Broadway.

"On the Twentieth Century," a madcap 1930s comedy that takes place on a luxury train traveling from Chicago to New York, has been nominated for five Tony awards.

They include a nod for best revival of a musical and best actress for Chenoweth as temperamental Hollywood star Lily Garland, opposite Peter Gallagher who plays her former love, the bankrupt producer Oscar Jaffee.

"I've always wanted to be in a show that wins a Tony," Chenoweth said during an interview. "I'm going for the gold with this one."

In the musical, Oscar tries to convince Lily to return to the stage, and him, to salvage his floundering career.

Chenoweth's powerhouse voice belies her thin, petite frame as she belts out a range of songs in a role that one critic said was tailor-made for her talent and skills.

With her role as co-host and nominee announced only a week ago, Chenoweth is still adjusting to being cited and co-hosting with actor Alan Cumming. The show will be broadcast live by CBS from Radio City Music Hall in New York on June 7.

"Well, since the nominations just came out we're kind of, spit-balling. We're trying to figure out what we want to do," she said. "The thing about the Tonys that I love is that it always celebrates the shows themselves."

The role of Lily holds particular importance for the actress. Chenoweth's idol, the late Madeline Kahn, originally played the role when the musical opened on Broadway in 1978. Kahn died in 1999.

"I hope Madeline Kahn is looking down and is smiling," she said.

Harold Prince, the director of the original production, praised the revival, but Gallagher said he gets the most satisfaction from how fans react.

"The audience every night is the best response because people are on their feet, regardless of how they start, they are just smiling and they can't believe how much fun they are having," he said.

Country group Zac Brown Band scored a third chart-topping album on the weekly U.S. Billboard 200 album chart on Wednesday, beating singer Josh Groban to the coveted top spot.

"Jekyll + Hyde," the fourth album by the Atlanta-based band, sold 214,000 albums, 115,000 songs and was streamed online 3.9 million times, totaling 228,000 units according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan.

Groban came in at No. 2 with his latest album "Stages," covering songs made famous in musicals such as "The Phantom of The Opera," and "Les Miserables," which sold 180,000 units.

The Billboard 200 chart tallies album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).

The only other new entry to crack the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart this week was country artist Tyler Farr's "Suffer in Peace," at No. 4.

Last week's chart-topper, "Sound & Color," by Alabama Shakes, dropped to No. 7.

On the Digital Songs chart, which measures online download sales, Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's "See You Again," from the "Furious 7" soundtrack held steady at No. 1 with a further 285,000 digital sales in the past week.

As a prominent cast member of "Saturday Night Live" for a decade, Kristen Wiig played characters from political figures to pop stars, but in her latest film, the comedian taps into a more complex and serious side of life.

In "Welcome to Me," opening in U.S. theaters and video-on-demand on Friday, Wiig plays Alice Kleig, a secluded woman with borderline personality disorder who wins the lottery and secures herself a televised talk show.

Wiig talked to Reuters about portraying mental health in a comedy and "Ghostbusters." Below are excerpts from the interview:

Q: How does the film tackle exploring Alice's mental health in the context of a dark comedy?

A: Considering that there were comedic moments in the movie, we had to have a lot of conversations about how that comedy was going to be portrayed because it was never our intention to make fun of her or have her be this crazy person that we laugh at.

She does have this disorder and she does suffer. At the same time, she legitimately does things that are funny and odd and it's OK to laugh because that's who she is as a person. But we wanted to be really respectful of that.

Q: How does this film comment on today's world?

A: Fame from the outside looks like the perfect life, the answer to all your problems, and it does have this glitter around it. And I think that the fact that the first thing she wanted to do is be seen says a lot about being a human being.

Her coming from this place of probable isolation and not leaving her house, and now she has this opportunity to connect with people, is something that people will relate to.

Q: How do you think comedy has evolved for female comedians?

A: I started "SNL" 10 years ago, and people have been asking me about women and comedy since I started on that show.

To some point, it's good because the answer (now) is a little more positive, there are more projects involving women and directed by women, but at the same time, the more we talk about it, the more we're saying it's still an issue. We still have a long way to go.

Q: How do you feel about the "all female" label on the new "Ghostbusters" reboot you're leading with a female cast?

A: Even when I was doing press for "Bridesmaids," people kept calling it a female comedy. I was like, 'Can't we just call it a comedy? We don't say male comedy.' I think that also implies that only women want to see it, and I don't think that's the case. Funny is funny.

Q: Which Ghostbusters character are you most like - Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) or Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis)?

A: Bill Murray. Venkman for sure.

Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Prince will perform a special concert in Baltimore on Sunday, apparently in part to honor the 25-year-old black man whose death from spinal injuries suffered in police custody sparked weeks of protest and a day of rioting.

The Grammy award-winning musician will hold his "Rally 4 Peace" show on Mother's Day along with his backing band 3RDEYEGIRL, Royal Farms Arena said in a statement on Tuesday night. The statement added that "superstar guests" were also expected to attend.

"Wear something gray," reads a promotional image for the concert, seemingly to reference Freddie Gray, who died last month after a week in the hospital following his April 12 arrest.

Gray's death became the latest flashpoint in a national outcry over police killings of unarmed black men and other minority groups in the United States, and provoked weeks of largely peaceful protests in the city punctuated by a day of arson and looting on April 27.

Last Friday, Baltimore's chief prosecutor announced charges against all six police officers involved in Gray's arrest, ranging from misconduct in office to second degree murder.

A representative for Prince could not be immediately reached for comment.

The Baltimore Sun newspaper said the artist was expected to perform a protest song, dubbed "Baltimore", which has not been released.

The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood have joined forces with British soul singer Beverley Knight to record a charity single in aid of victims of last month's earthquake in Nepal.

The track, entitled "Look into Your Heart" will raise funds for charity Save The Children's Nepal Earthquake Appeal.

Wood said he was "delighted" to be able to take part in the recording, which features Knight on lead vocals and Jagger on backing vocals. They are accompanied by a 100-strong assembled choir of the charity's supporters.

"The terrible events in Nepal show just how vulnerable our fellow man can be in the face of nature," Knight said.

"My hope is that the proceeds of this song will go some way to help raise urgently needed funds to repair homes and restore lives."

The track was produced by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason.

More than 7,500 people were killed and hundreds of thousands left homeless by the quake, which struck on April 25.

The agents of Britain's MI5 hit the silver screen this week in a film adaptation of popular British television spy drama "Spooks".

"Spooks: The Greater Good" stars some of the original drama cast, such as Peter Firth, as well as new faces including "Game of Thrones" actor Kit Harington.

The BBC series, which ran from 2002 to 2011, won many fans as well as numerous awards and Harington says the film stays true to the spirit of the spy show.

"I think 'Spooks' always wanted to be a film. It wanted to have the big explosion. It wanted to have the sweeping shot of London. It wanted to have bigger action scenes," he said during a promotional interview.

"So, what's similar is that it's still a gritty, spy thriller based in London and still in a very real world. What's different is that it's bigger on scope. We got to do things in this that they couldn't do in the TV show."

The film follows Firth's character, Sir Harry Pearce, as he tries to find a traitor inside MI5 who may have helped a convicted militant escape from custody in London.

Pearce has to go underground to get the help of Will Holloway, played by Harington, whom he decommissioned from the service years before, to find out who betrayed the agency.

"Spooks" was known for killing off major characters, especially at unexpected times, also a feature in popular HBO series "Game of Thrones."

"It pre-dated 'Thrones' and it did things that we're ('Game of Thrones') now credited for (doing in) changing drama," Harington said. "I think there's always shows before really huge ones that do that and I think 'Spooks' did do that."

"Spooks: The Greater Good" hits UK cinemas on Friday.

Prada -- the Devil's favorite fashion brand, as the film and book would have it -- is launching a giant multi-disciplinary arts complex on the edge of Milan that it hopes will attract tens of thousands of visitors a year.

The Italian fashion house opens a 19,000-square-meter (205,000-square-foot) headquarters for its art foundation on May 9 in a century-old ex-distillery transformed and extended by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas.

The inaugural program features an exhibition on classical sculpture and a special appearance by Polish-born filmmaker Roman Polanski, who will present a documentary and a series of film screenings looking back on directors who influenced him most.

Koolhaas has added three new buildings to the existing structure: an exhibition pavilion, a tower and a cinema. A mixed program of art exhibitions, film screenings and philosophy projects is planned.

The Fondazione Prada also boasts a bar designed by filmmaker Wes Anderson ("The Grand Budapest Hotel"), who has modeled it after historic Milanese cafes.

"There's no museum of contemporary art in Milan and no real dedication from the municipality to promote" such art, said Astrid Welter, project director of the Fondazione Prada. "This is why it was seen as a necessity to come in with an offering."

Every other year, Italy stages the world's biggest art exhibition -- the Venice Art Biennale -- hosting a roster of cutting-edge artists from around the world.

Yet the Italian government has otherwise been slow to embrace contemporary art within its museums and institutions. It was not until May 2010 that the country got its first national museum of contemporary art, Rome's MAXXI.

Companies and private individuals have stepped in to fill the gap. Prada started its contemporary art foundation in 1993, staging exhibitions and events in Milan, Venice and elsewhere.

Since 2004, Pirelli, the world's fifth-largest tire maker, has run an exhibition hall outside Milan, in a 15,000-square-metre ex-factory where locomotive components were once built.

Hangar Bicocca, as it is known, has a 2015 budget of 3.5 million euros ($3.89 million), and in the past decade has hosted shows by such big names as Serbian-born performance artist Marina Abramovic and France's Christian Boltanski.

While Hangar Bicocca lacks a collection of its own, Prada's co-founders Miuccia Prada and Fabrizio Bertelli own a substantial number of artworks that their Fondazione's curators will draw on to put together exhibitions, Welter said.

The collection includes works of post-war European and American art by such artists as Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri, and Walter De Maria, she said.

Popular South Korean boy band Bigbang is back on the music scene after a three-year hiatus, with a new single delving into the stresses of daily life.

The track, entitled "Loser", has dominated South Korea's online music charts since its release on May 1 and its video has seen more than 12 million hits on YouTube. It has also ranked top on the iTunes single charts of Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Taiwan, where the band has many fans.

The quintet had taken time off while band members focused on their solo careers. They hope to release a single a month until August, culminating in a new album in September.

"Society is very competitive. I think the word 'loser' can explain many problems from competition and many people are struggling to survive," band member Taeyang said in an interview on Wednesday. "It is comforting that we are singing on their behalf and that is why people love this song."

While Korean pop, known as "K-pop," projects a wholesome image to its fans, it has also been criticized by some of the public for its cut-throat competition and the way it treats young talent, such as excessively long hours and low pay until they make it big.

"Many training places churn out the same people," Taeyang said. "I believe music must show the identities that each of us has."

The "Korean Wave" of music has swamped Asia, winning fans from Tokyo to Singapore and beyond but it has had little impact in Europe and the United States with the exception of Psy's "Gangnam Style" hit in 2012.

Bigbang, which lead singer G-Dragon hopes can reap success further west, are known for being heavily involved in their music production as opposed to other K-pop groups which focus on their slick dance routines.

The band is managed by YG Entertainment Inc, one of South Korea's three main K-pop talent agencies, with acts including Psy and a market value of $637 million. YG said last year the private equity arm of French luxury goods giant LVMH would invest up to $80 million in the firm.

Michael Jackson's glove and George Harrison's guitar star in an auction next week which could fetch up to $4 million.

Julien's Auctions will host its Music Icons sale on May 15-16 in New York. Among the music royalty items on sale are an American flag tank top worn by Madonna and a black crown worn by Beyonce in her "Haunted" music video.

"It's really an eclectic auction of a lot of items from Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Madonna, so many items to choose from pop culture history," Darren Julien, president and CEO of Julien's Auctions, said at a preview in Beverly Hills.

"We anticipate the entire auction could bring in somewhere between 2 and 4 million dollars."

A Mastersound electric guitar played by Beatle Harrison is one of the highlights of the sale and is estimated to fetch up to $600,000.

"It's a guitar that he played in 1963 at various performances throughout the UK," Julien said. "(He) also played it at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, which is really one of their historic performances."

Fans of the "king of pop" will be able to purchase Jackson's hat and sunglasses as well as one of his gloves.

An Indian court sentenced Bollywood film star Salman Khan on Wednesday to five years in prison for killing a man in a hit-and-run accident, the latest twist in the tumultuous career of one of the country's biggest box-office draws.

The district criminal court's order drove down shares of firms connected to the actor and, if upheld, will derail major projects in the pipeline of what is the world's most prolific movie industry.

Khan later secured two days of interim bail from Mumbai's high court and will return to court on Friday for a hearing on having the bail extended.

The criminal court convicted Khan, 49, of culpable homicide on charges that he lost control of his white Toyota Landcruiser when driving under the influence of alcohol in 2002, and rammed into a group of people sleeping on a pavement.

Khan, instantly recognizable by his muscular build, denied being behind the wheel, contradicting the testimony of several witnesses. In March, the actor's driver said he had driven, while Khan rode in the passenger seat.

In his verdict, Judge D.W. Deshpande said Khan had in fact been driving the car.

"Finally, justice has been done," said senior lawyer Abha Singh, a petitioner in the case. "The law has been upheld."

The decision dispelled the idea that India is a country where people with money and power can commit murder and get away with it, Singh added.

Some fans and Bollywood celebrities came out in support of Khan, with one playback singer stoking controversy by likening the victim to a dog sleeping on a pavement.

"Roads footpath r not meant 4 sleeping, not driver's or alcohol's fault," Abhijeet Bhattacharya tweeted.

Wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, Khan sweated heavily when the verdict was delivered amid a power cut at the criminal court. No emotion was evident on the face of Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable stars in a country where movie and cricket stars are hero-worshipped.

Khan's portrayals of working class characters hold broad appeal for young audiences across India, who are drawn to his image of a bad boy with a heart of gold. Khan is a bachelor.

The news of his conviction led to a fall of 6 percent in shares of movie production and distribution firm Eros International, and a drop of 3 percent in shares of textile company Mandhana Industries.

Eros had acquired global distribution rights for two of Khan's upcoming movies while Mandhana worked with his foundation to design and distribute the "Being Human" clothing range.

The conviction is not Khan's first brush with the law. In 2007, he was jailed for nearly a week for shooting an endangered gazelle on a hunting trip in the desert state of Rajasthan. He is also on bail in a case over the killing of protected antelopes.

Two of Khan's big films were lined up for release this year - director Kabir Khan’s "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" and "Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo", directed by Sooraj Barjatya.

Aiming to show the human side of North Dakota's oil industry, the Smithsonian Channel's "Boomtowners" chronicles the highs and lows of transplants to one of the nation's fastest-growing economies.

Producers of the show, which airs the third of six episodes this Sunday night, deliberately sidestepped any focus on the environmental concerns of hydraulic fracturing, the controversial technique that uses high-pressure water laced with sand and chemicals to coax oil and natural gas out of the ground.

Instead, "Boomtowners" tells the stories of some of the thousands of people who relocate to rural North Dakota for a fresh start in the oil boom, where roughly 1.2 million barrels of crude are extracted each day.

"This is a character-driven series," said David Royle, head of programing and production at the Smithsonian Channel, a joint venture between the museum and CBS Corp. "Coming through this whole thing is a sense of the pioneer spirit, which is a truly American phenomenon."

The show, which uses drone-mounted cameras for unique shots of the North Dakota landscape, tracks eight groups of people, including an itinerant evangelist working as a safety inspector and a lesbian couple running a trucking company.

Rather than gawk or patronize, "Boomtowners" often is at pains to accurately depict life in a region many consider forlorn.

"I think people have begun to realize that what we're doing here is not reality programing of the kind that takes place in Swampland, Louisiana," said Royle, in a reference to A&E Network's "Duck Dynasty."

"Being the Smithsonian Channel has its advantages," he added.

It was the Smithsonian's involvement that first attracted Ben Moorhead and his wife Phoebe, who moved from Arizona in 2010.

"I thought it would be a fun experience to show folks what life is like here," Ben Moorhead, who drives an oil delivery truck and is one of the show's main subjects, said in an interview. "I do like the social values out here because there's a lot of hard-working folks."

CHEAP OIL

The show was filmed last summer, when oil prices – and salaries - were higher.

Indeed, the narrator bluntly declares in the pilot episode that "a steep drop in the price of oil would affect the entire region."

That statement proved to be prophetic, as a more than 40 percent drop in oil prices since last August has fueled job cuts.

The show has effectively become a kind of time capsule, evoking the not-so-recent past when North Dakota actually had the nation's largest unemployment rate - now held by Nebraska - and the gold-rush mentality reigned supreme.

Royle defended the disconnect, pointing out that "Boomtowners" tries to capture a slice of time in the vein of a documentary, rather than offering an up-to-the-second glimpse of oilfield life.

None of the show's characters have been laid off yet, Royle added.

"I'm still making a very handsome living doing what I'm doing," said Ben Moorhead, the truck driver. "The boom hasn't died, but it's slowed down to the point beyond just needing warm bodies."

Austrian prosecutors have charged the owner of a basement filled with Adolf Hitler paraphernalia as a Nazi sympathizer after his collection featured in a documentary film by cult director Ulrich Seidl last year.

Re-engagement with National Socialism has been a crime since 1947 in Austria, which for decades maintained that it was Hitler's first victim and often glossed over the enthusiastic welcome he got from many Austrians.

Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Hitler's birthplace, in 1938.

The scene from Seidl's "Im Keller" (In the Basement) shows five men in traditional dress singing a drinking song in a room featuring a portrait of Hitler, a swastika flag and mannequins wearing Nazi uniforms and helmets.

Two conservative council members in the eastern town of Eisenstadt resigned from their posts and left the People's Party after appearing in the scene in Seidl's film.

Prosecutors in Eisenstadt have charged the owner of the basement, whom they did not name, based on witness statements collected after the documentary's release last year.

The man can appeal the charges, which carry up to 10 years in prison, a spokesman for the prosecution said, adding that investigations into the other men filmed have been dropped.

The suspect had told Austrian media last year that he was merely "a collector", not a Nazi.
