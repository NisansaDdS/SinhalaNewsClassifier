New York state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Republican, and his son are expected to be arrested next week on federal corruption charges, The New York Times reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.

The criminal charges against Skelos, 67, and his son, Adam, 32, were expected to be detailed in a criminal complaint and likely will include conspiracy, extortion and solicitation of bribes, the newspaper quoted one source as saying.

The Times reported that the charges could be announced as early as Monday.

Investigators have been looking into the business dealings of Adam Skelos, including his hiring by an Arizona company that won a local government contract in New York although it was not the low bidder, and a $20,000 signing bonus from a title insurance company that never employed him, the Times said.

In question is whether the elder Skelos used his political influence to help the Arizona company, AbTech Industries, which won a $12 million storm-water treatment contract from Nassau County on Long Island, the senator's home district, the newspaper said.

Federal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York have been presenting evidence to a grand jury for several weeks, the newspaper reported.

Skelos, his attorney and a representative for the U.S. Attorney could not be immediately reached for comment.

New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was charged in January with pocketing $4 million from bribery and kickback schemes. He resigned as speaker after his arrest. Silver lost a bid last week to dismiss the federal corruption charges.

Both cases stem from a 2013 anti-corruption panel known as the Moreland Commission that was created and abruptly dismantled by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a move that triggered an investigation by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.

Bharara has castigated Albany for housing "one of the most corrupt governments in the nation" and said the concentration of power among the "three men in the room" - as Cuomo, Silver and Skelos were widely known - may be part of the problem.

Ohio Governor John Kasich said on Friday his 2016 presidential aspirations depend on whether he can raise enough money to compete with a host of rivals for the Republican nomination.

Kasich, 62, is considering a run for his party's nomination, which would make him a potentially potent force in the Republican field as he represents an important swing state in presidential elections.

But with more than a dozen Republicans either already in the race or about to enter it, Kasich could easily be just another face on a crowded stage searching for his own breakout moment.

Kasich, a former chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee who was re-elected as Ohio's governor in November, sounded like a presidential candidate during a 45-minute session with reporters at a lunch sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.

Kasich, who considered running for the White House in 2000 before bowing out of the race, said he was optimistic that he will be able to move forward with launching a campaign, but did not indicate when he would make up his mind.

"I'm going to determine whether I’ll have the resources to win. If I don't have the resources and I can’t see a path to victory, I’m not going to do that," Kasich said.

Kasich, who served 18 years in Congress, touted his experience as a key selling point for why Republican voters would want to give him a look.

A fiscal conservative with an independent streak, he said he would want to take on the role of problem-solver.

"The country's got a lot of problems. I think whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, the anxiety is not much different," he said.

Kasich's decision to expand Medicaid, a government-funded health program for the poor, in Ohio through President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law has drawn scorn from conservatives.

Many Republican governors have opted not to expand Medicaid out of opposition to the law, also known as Obamacare. The White House says that position deprives the residents of those states of the federal dollars that would be available to them.

Kasich defended his decision, saying the money is being used to treat 10,000 mentally ill inmates in Ohio prisons.

"Here's what I'm faced with. I've got money I can bring home to Ohio ... It's not Washington's. It's the money that belongs to the people of our state," he said.

Kasich also was unwilling to give his unabashed support to free trade legislation that Obama and Republicans are trying to get passed in Congress, saying he was concerned about its impact on the U.S. labor market.

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, launched a long-shot bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, a move likely to pressure Hillary Clinton from the left on issues from income inequality to corporate governance.

Sanders, one of the most outspoken liberals in Congress, called for rebuilding the middle class and reducing the influence of wealthy Americans and businesses on U.S. elections.

"This country today, in my view, has more serious crises than at any time since the Great Depression," Sanders said at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol. "How do we create an economy that works for all of our people, rather than a small number of billionaires?"

The 73-year-old, second-term senator faces long odds against the fund-raising might and name recognition of Clinton - the Democratic front-runner and former U.S. secretary of state, senator and first lady - to head the Democratic presidential slate in the November 2016 election.
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Her campaign barely three weeks old, Hillary Clinton already has been attacked by Republicans on everything from donations to her family's charitable foundation, to her tenure as secretary of state and her ties to Wall Street. But her rivals, and the political action committees that support them, are treading more carefully on one incendiary subject: her age.

If elected in November 2016, Clinton would be, at 69, the second-oldest person to take the presidential oath for the first time, behind only Ronald Reagan, who turned 70 weeks after being sworn into office in 1981.

Questions of health and fitness for the presidency dogged two former candidates of a similar age, Bob Dole in the 1996 election and John McCain in 2008, each of whom was 71 at this point in the race. Time magazine featured Dole on the cover asking whether he was "too old" for the job. McCain was so determined to show that he was healthy that he often put in back-breaking campaign days.
"I do think age is an issue in a presidential campaign," said Steve Schmidt, who was McCain’s campaign manager. "There is a thin line between seasoned and decrepit."

But several Republican campaigns that seem best positioned to exploit it don't want to touch the issue - at least directly. That's a shift from just a few months ago, when presidential hopefuls Senator Rand Paul, 52, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, 47, explicitly referenced Clinton’s age as a possible disqualifier, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell likened her to a cast member of the hit TV show “The Golden Girls,” which featured four older women living together.

"It’s a rigorous physical ordeal, I think, to be able to campaign for the presidency," Paul said in November, referring to Clinton's age. Now, however, Paul’s presidential campaign doesn’t want to talk about the issue. It declined further comment. As did Walker’s political action committee, even though last fall, he, too, noted that he could run for president "20 years from now" and be the same age Clinton is today.

Campaign aides to Paul, Walker and Senator Marco Rubio, 43, as well as Republican strategists, told Reuters there was little appetite in the party at the moment for a direct assault on Clinton on the issues of her age and fitness for office, even after a 2012 fall that gave her a concussion and caused a potentially life-threatening blood clot.

Similarly, anti-Clinton political action committees such as American Crossroads, America Rising, and Citizens United said they had no plans to launch ads centered on her age.

 POLL SHOWS DEMOCRATS UNFAZED

"It’s unwise to attack a political opponent based on her immutable characteristics, like race, gender and age," said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway. She said she has met with at least five Republican presidential campaigns seeking her services and none of them has indicated they want to go after Clinton on issues involving her age.

With Clinton swamped by questions about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and criticism of her use of a private email server while at the State Department, there is also simply no reason at the moment to engage in an attack that could be more divisive than beneficial, Republican strategists said.

They fear that highlighting Clinton’s age could alienate women voters whom Republicans need to be competitive in next year’s general election.

Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said women older than 50 would likely comprise the largest bloc of voters in 2016.

There is little evidence that Democrats and independent voters are concerned about having another president in their 70s. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month showed that Clinton’s age would not influence how 67 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of independents voted in November 2016.

And rather than downplay her age, Clinton in recent campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire embraced her role as a grandmother, striking sympathetic notes with other older women in the room about the responsibility of raising a grandchild.

Supporters have also sought to dismiss any concerns about her age as sexist, noting that she’s the same age as Mitt Romney when he ran four years ago. Romney largely avoided any protracted discussion about his health.

IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING

While eschewing direct attacks, some of the Republican presidential hopefuls have found other ways to strongly hint that Clinton's age should be an issue for voters. They have repackaged the issue as "generational" and suggested she is a product of the politics of the 20th Century. That argument will grow more vivid should Clinton face a candidate who could be a generation younger than her in the general election.

“When you look at Hilary Clinton’s age, it becomes an issue in a general election if she’s running against a 40-something new face as opposed to Governor Bush,” said Schmidt. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, is 62.

Rubio, a quarter century younger than Clinton, referred to her as a "leader from yesterday" when he announced his candidacy last month.

"We welcome the contrast (with Clinton)," said a top adviser to Rubio. "This election is going to be about the future."

Clinton's campaign declined to comment on the various statements by the Republican hopefuls, referring questions to Correct the Record, a rapid-response operation run by the pro-Clinton group American Bridge. A spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson, said it was Clinton's rivals, not her, who were behind the times.

"Republican politicians are stuck in the 90s - the 1890s," Watson said. "I'm sure all Americans, Republicans included, would appreciate it if Republican leaders would join (Clinton) in talking about our future."

She saw Rubio's comments as a coded attack on Clinton's age.

"Marco Rubio basically disqualifies himself to be president when he diminishes any American for being too young or old or anything else," Watson said.

 

BILL CLINTON'S PLAYBOOK

Yet Rubio's approach is similar to the one employed by Clinton’s husband, Bill, in his reelection campaign against Dole in 1996.

"I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president,” Clinton said at one debate. “It's the age of his ideas that I question."

Dick Morris, who served as Bill Clinton’s campaign manager, said it was a subtle enough way to remind voters of the age difference between the two candidates.

"We obviously couldn’t attack age directly because of older voters," Morris told Reuters. "What we did is adopt a whole strategy based on issues that would summon the memories and ideas of age without articulating it."

Dole released his medical records in 1995 to assuage concerns about his age. But the damage control was not entirely successful: he mistakenly called the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team “Brooklyn,” and he tumbled off a stage during a rally.

Hillary Clinton, too, had what her husband seemed to term a “senior” moment in 2008 when she erroneously claimed she had come under sniper fire while on a trip to Bosnia as first lady.

Bill Clinton blamed the episode on his wife being exhausted, adding that her critics, “when they’re 60, they’ll forget something when they’re tired at 11 at night, too.”

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush on Thursday rejected a contention from Republican rival Marco Rubio that a governor would not be able to manage U.S. foreign policy if elected president in an early sign of their 2016 battle to come.

Bush, who is exploring a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, sought to allay concerns about his conservative credentials at a forum run by a conservative magazine, National Review.

Rubio, a first-term Florida senator, has gained some early momentum in his own race for the Republican nomination for the 2016 election by touting his foreign policy credentials, which includes membership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Governors can certainly read about foreign policy, and take briefings and meet with experts, but there is no way they’ll be ready on Day One to manage U.S. foreign policy," Rubio told the Des Moines Register last weekend.

Bush, who has avoid criticizing Rubio to date, was asked about whether governors could in fact conduct foreign policy. Bush was governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.

"Wow. Let me think. Ronald Reagan?" he said, referring to the 1980s Republican president who had been governor of California.

"You can be prepared from Day One from being a governor," he said.

And in a jab intended for senators who like Rubio and Rand Paul are either in the 2016 or thinking about getting in, Bush added that governors "can't hide behind the collective skirt and say, 'well, I passed an amendment about this..."

"They actually have to lead. They have to make decisions. They have to convince. They actually have to compromise from time to time," he said.

Bush also quibbled with Rubio's attempt to amend Senate legislation that is seeking to ensure Senate oversight of President Barack Obama's proposed nuclear deal with Iran.

Rubio wants the legislation to include a requirement that Iran recognize Israel's right to exist.

"I understand the sentiment," Bush said. "I don't know if that kills the bill, you have no oversight."

Rubio has cast himself as a fresh face who could move the country past the Bush and Clinton dynasties that have led American politics for decades and are seeking to again.

Bush has struggled with some conservatives by pushing a more moderate stance on immigration. In his National Review appearance, he stuck to his position that illegal immigrants should have the ability to earn legal status.

The State Department said Thursday that the new trove of documents it has provided Congress from its own investigation into the deadly 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya do not change the "essential facts" known about the attack.

The facts set out by the State Department's "Accountability Review Board" (ARB) report, released in December 2012, did not find former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- now a Democratic presidential candidate -- responsible for security lapses in Benghazi.

But the report concluded that the U.S. mission in Benghazi was unprepared for the attack, and outlined widespread failings within the State Department while Clinton was in charge.

Four Americans including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed when militants stormed U.S. facilities in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on the night of Sept. 11, 2012.

U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who heads the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said earlier Thursday that the State Department had given his panel some 4,000 pages from its 2012 ARB probe into Benghazi. He said it was the first time State had handed Congress papers from an ARB, special panels that State sets up to investigate attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities.

A State Department letter to Gowdy reviewed by Reuters last week made clear the department was unhappy about relinquishing the ARB files, saying it worried "the prospect of congressional scrutiny could have a chilling effect" on future ARBs.

"I’m not going to characterize the contents of the documents that were provided, except to say that they don’t change the essential facts that have been known since the accountability review board report came out,” State's spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Thursday.

A Democratic aide to the Benghazi committee went further, saying the ARB papers "identified no evidence to support claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a stand-down, personally denied security requests, oversaw a covert weapons program, or any of the other wild claims Republicans have been making for months."

Republicans say the State Department under Clinton failed to protect diplomatic personnel in Benghazi. Democrats say the panel's efforts are politically motivated to undercut Clinton's 2016 presidential candidacy.

The State Department has already turned over thousands of pages of other documents to Gowdy's panel. The House committee is also investigating Clinton's use of a private email server, and plans to have her testify.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed the first joint House-Senate budget plan in six years on Thursday, a measure that aids the party's goal of dismantling President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law this year.

The Republican-authored plan would eliminate deficits by 2024 through deep cuts to social programs while increasing military spending by nearly $40 billion next year.

It passed 226-197 with no Democrats supporting it and 14 Republicans opposing it.

The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to pass the budget plan next week. Because it is a non-binding resolution, Obama does not sign it into law and most of its prescribed cuts are cast aside.

The House quickly pivoted to follow-on spending bills, passing a $76.6 billion measure to fund the Veterans Affairs Department and military construction projects.

But that normally popular bill drew much more opposition from Democrats than in previous years and a veto threat from the White House, which said the measure would fail to provide adequate funding for veterans health care and military facilities.

The White House also said Obama's advisers would recommend he veto any other spending bills based on the Republican budget framework because it keeps "sequester" spending caps in place.

A protracted standoff over spending levels would raise the risk of another government shutdown when the 2016 fiscal year starts Oct. 1, with a debt limit increase needed perhaps a month later.

The Republican budget seeks to slash about $5.3 trillion from domestic spending over 10 years, with deep cuts to programs that serve the poor, education and infrastructure. It contains no tax increases.

"It will not only get Washington's fiscal house in order but pave the way for stronger economic growth, more jobs and more opportunity," Republican Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price said on the House floor.

Democrats criticized its use of an off-budget war funding account to boost military spending next year.

"This agreement uses gimmicks to balance the budget, and does so on the backs of the poor and the middle class and senior citizens," said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat.

Passage of the budget gives Republicans a rare opportunity to use a procedural tool that would ease the repeal or replacement of "Obamacare."

This will allow them to pass such legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than a nearly impossible 60-vote threshold that would require the support of some Democrats.

A dispute among Republican senators over changes to an Iran nuclear review bill on Thursday threatened the measure's chances of being passed by the U.S. Congress, leaving Senate leaders scrambling for a way to advance the legislation.

Two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, used an unorthodox procedural move to try to force the Senate to vote on their amendments to a bill authored by another Republican senator, Bob Corker, that would give Congress the right to review an international nuclear agreement with Iran.

Rubio, a 2016 presidential hopeful, and Cotton, a leading congressional critic of President Barack Obama's Iran policy, want to toughen the bill with amendments including adding a requirement that Iran recognize Israel's right to exist as part of any nuclear deal.

Senate aides said the two made their move on Thursday just as Republicans and Democrats were finalizing an agreement on how to handle at least 66 amendments proposed by Republicans to the Iran Nuclear Review Act.

"I have a sense that the context of this has just changed," Corker said. "I regret that."

The Senate has been engaged in intense debate over the legislation, a compromise version of the bill reached in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week in an effort to avoid a presidential veto.

The White House had said some of the stronger provisions of the original measure would have threatened delicate international talks between Iran and world powers over Tehran's nuclear program. The negotiators have given themselves until the end of June to reach a final agreement, which members of Congress want to review.

Corker and Ben Cardin, the committee's Republican chairman and top Democrat, have been arguing against so-called poison pill amendments. They say such amendments would alienate many Democrats who now support the measure and prompt a veto.

Senators voted down two such controversial amendments earlier this week.

There was some optimism about the bill's long-term prospects, however. Senate aides said they expected the Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, would take steps as early as Monday to stop debate on the bill and allow a vote on a "clean" version, without amendments.

But a spokesman said late on Thursday that McConnell had not yet said whether he would do so, and that Senate leaders were still trying to find a way to have votes on amendments.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday reversed $26 million in surprise spending cuts that had forced the shutdown of a stop-smoking hotline and ended funding for some autism programs and indigent funerals.

Officials at the governor's office said higher-than-expected personal income tax revenue allowed the Republican governor to restore the grants for social services, in the budget that ends on June 30.

The cuts, announced on April 3, came as a surprise after Rauner and the Democratic-controlled legislature had agreed to a 2.25 percent across-the-board spending cut and a cash infusion from other state funds to plug a $1.6 billion gap.

Social service providers said they were pleased that grants were restored.

"The decision caused a sigh of relief on behalf of many parents who are concerned about their children's future," said Mark Schmidt, spokesman for the Autism Program of Illinois, or TAP, which had lost $1 million in a grant after the April 3 announcement.

Programs funded through TAP would be able to rehire a handful of people laid off earlier this month, Schmidt said."We're pleased and grateful the decision was made and the resources were found. Now we have to work on funding for fiscal year 2016," Schmidt said.

More pain from austerity looms for Illinois, which has the lowest credit rating of all U.S. states.

The state's credit rating, which play a big role in determining the cost of borrowing funds, could tip closer to the junk-bond status assigned to the riskiest debt if Illinois does not address its chronic unbalanced budget.

Rauner took office in January pledging to plug a huge structural deficit without relying on higher taxes or borrowing. In the fiscal year beginning July 1, Rauner has proposed a budget he says will eliminate a $6.2 billion deficit.

There was some good news this week for the current budget, and Rauner's office said there would be no more spending reductions.

Personal income taxes were higher than expected in April, likely fueled by capital gains and dividend income, said Jim Muschinske, revenue manager at the Illinois legislature's Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. He added that could help boost state revenue for the current fiscal year by $300 million to $500 million.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed the first joint House-Senate budget plan in six years on Thursday, a measure that aids the party's goal of dismantling President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law this year.

The Republican-authored plan would eliminate deficits by 2024 through deep cuts to social programs while increasing military spending by nearly $40 billion next year.

It passed 226-197 largely on party lines. No Democrats supported it, while 14 Republicans voted against it.

The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to pass the budget plan next week. Because it is a non-binding resolution, Obama does not sign it into law.

The budget seeks to slash about $5.3 trillion from domestic spending over 10 years, with deep cuts to programs that serve the poor, education and infrastructure. It contains no tax increases.

Republicans hailed it as the first balanced budget plan since a brief period of U.S. surpluses from 1998 through 2001.

"It will not only get Washington's fiscal house in order but pave the way for stronger economic growth, more jobs and more opportunity," Republican Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price said on the House floor.

Democrats derided the plan as claiming a "phony" balance by calling for repeal of the Affordable Care Act but maintaining tax revenue levels associated with the law. The plan also skirts "sequester" spending caps to boost military budgets by funneling $38 billion to an off-budget war operations account next year.

"This agreement uses gimmicks to balance the budget, and does so on the backs of the poor and the middle class and senior citizens," said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat.

While most of the prescribed cuts in the blueprint will be ignored as Congress pivots to annual government agency spending bills, its passage gives Republicans a rare opportunity to use a budget procedural tool that would ease the repeal or replacement of "Obamacare."

This will allow them to pass such legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than a nearly impossible 60-vote threshold that would require the support of some Democrats.

While Obama has vowed to veto any attempt to dismantle Obamacare, he may be forced to compromise with Republicans if a Supreme Court ruling in June strikes down the health insurance subsidy structure at the heart of the law.

A bill to end spy agencies' bulk collection of Americans' telephone data advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, setting up a potential showdown over the program, which expires on June 1.

The House Judiciary Committee voted 25-2 to approve the "USA Freedom Act," seeking to tighten control of a program publicly exposed two years ago by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

The bill would bar the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act and other intelligence authorities, and it would increase transparency and accountability in surveillance programs.

A similar bill has been introduced in the U.S. Senate.

The bills are supported by privacy groups but will run into opposition in Congress and at the White House.

Democratic President Barack Obama and many lawmakers want to retain the mass data-collection program as a national security tool, although they are open to changes.

A vote on the bill could take place in the House as soon as next month.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives who are trying to end the decades-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports said on Thursday they were gaining support after a Democrat joined the Republican-led effort. Representative Henry Cuellar became the first Democrat to sign on to a bill launched in February by Representative Joe Barton, a Republican and fellow Texan.

"If we are able to lift the crude oil ban this is going to open up new markets where Texas businesses can create more jobs at home," said Cuellar, whose district includes the oilfields of Eagle Ford, where much of the U.S. boom in light sweet crude has been taking place over the last half decade.

"I've seen communities, especially the rural communities change, I've seen jobs, economic development," Cuellar told reporters at press conference.

He said he has talked with other Democrats and expects they will come on board if the bill reaches the House floor.

Since Barton unveiled the bill, the number of co-sponsors has risen from about 11 to 23 in the 435-member chamber.

"Henry's the first one, but he's not the last" Democrat that will support the bill, Barton said.

The bill has also gained its first support from Republican leadership: Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, the chamber's No. 3 most senior position.

Congress passed the crude oil export ban in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo led to fears of shortages in global oil markets.

But thanks to the revolution in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and other drilling techniques, the United States is now vying with Russia and Saudi Arabia for the position as the world's top oil producer.

In the Senate, Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and the chairman of the energy committee, has said she will launch a bill to lift the ban this year, though she has not yet indicated when it will be introduced. [ID:nL1N0XH1T3]

Murkowski is currently trying to add an amendment that would relax the ban to a bill that would allow Congress to review any deal with Iran over its nuclear program. It was not clear whether she can get a vote on the measure in the Senate.

Conservative presidential candidates hitting the 2016 campaign trail are firing up crowds with calls to shrink the U.S. government, but a new poll shows that Republican voters who rally to that cry still want to maintain many federal programs.

    Ideas such as abolishing the U.S. income tax and shifting many of the federal government's responsibilities to the states draw robust support from Republican voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. But there is much weaker support for curbing government’s role in providing a social safety net and for curbing some of its regulatory functions.

    The results, from an online poll of 4,770 adults from April 10 to 24, highlight a dilemma for Republican candidates such as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas who have made reducing the size of government a top campaign theme. While many Americans, particularly Republicans and independents, favor decreasing government’s size and reach, specific policies for doing so are far less popular.

    Among Republicans, 51 percent support abolishing the U.S. federal income tax versus 39 percent who disagree. By 60 percent to 28 percent, Republicans said they believe state governments should have more authority than the federal government. Fifty-six percent of Republicans said the federal government should have very little authority over domestic affairs.

    Forty-seven percent of independents favored abolishing the income tax compared with 38 percent who are opposed. On whether the federal government should have less authority over domestic affairs, independents were evenly divided.

    But when asked about ending specific functions of the federal government, voters of all political stripes, including many Republicans, were less receptive. Nearly 80 percent of Republicans oppose eliminating middle-class entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare

Sixty-four percent of Republicans oppose getting rid of aid programs for the poor, such as food stamps and Medicaid. Forty-seven percent of Republicans disagree with abolishing or significantly reducing the authority of regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration. That compared with only 42 percent who agree.

    Among independents, 77 percent oppose abolishing programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and 70 percent were against eliminating Medicaid and food stamps. Fifty-six percent rejected the idea of eliminating or reducing agencies such as the FDA.

Adults 60 and older were the largest age group among respondents to the poll, comprising 28 percent. Those 18-29 made up 17 percent; those 30-39 and 40-49 each accounted for 16 percent. Respondents age 50-59 made up 23 percent.

Older voters tend to vote in higher numbers.

Paul hopes to build momentum for his presidential campaign by rallying the support of libertarians who supported the three White House bids of his father, Ron Paul. Playing to the base of support among libertarians, who favor a limited role for government, Paul has made curbing domestic spying one of his signature issues.

When he launched his 2016 presidential campaign on April 7, Paul railed against big government and federal deficits.

Cruz, a favorite of Tea Party voters, some of whom lean libertarian, says he wants to kill off the Internal Revenue Service tax-collection agency and would replace the current complicated tax code with a flat tax.

    One in five Americans consider themselves libertarian, with younger adults being the most likely to adopt the label. Among adults aged 18 to 29, 32 percent consider themselves libertarian. Just 12 percent of Americans age 60 or older consider themselves libertarian.

Matt Welch, editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, said young people are more likely to consider themselves “free agents,” and because of that are more likely to gravitate toward libertarianism. “They don’t belong to churches, they don’t belong to things,” he said.

    The Reuters/Ipsos poll had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1.6 percentage points for all adults.

"I’m not going to characterize the contents of the documents that were provided, except to say that they don’t change the essential facts that have been known since the accountability review board report came out,” State's spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Thursday.

A Democratic aide to the Benghazi committee went further, saying the ARB papers "identified no evidence to support claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a stand-down, personally denied security requests, oversaw a covert weapons program, or any of the other wild claims Republicans have been making for months."

Republicans say the State Department under Clinton failed to protect diplomatic personnel in Benghazi. Democrats say the panel's efforts are politically motivated to undercut Clinton's 2016 presidential candidacy.

The State Department has already turned over thousands of pages of other documents to Gowdy's panel. The House committee is also investigating Clinton's use of a private email server, and plans to have her testify.

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, launched a long-shot bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, a move likely to pressure Hillary Clinton from the left on issues from income inequality to corporate governance.

Sanders, one of the most outspoken liberals in Congress, called for rebuilding the middle class and reducing the influence of wealthy Americans and businesses on U.S. elections.

"This country today, in my view, has more serious crises than at any time since the Great Depression," Sanders said at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol. "How do we create an economy that works for all of our people, rather than a small number of billionaires?"

The 73-year-old, second-term senator faces long odds against the fund-raising might and name recognition of Clinton - the Democratic front-runner and former U.S. secretary of state, senator and first lady - to head the Democratic presidential slate in the November 2016 election.

Sanders highlighted his fight against authorizing the Iraq war, which Clinton voted for as a senator, and his opposition to trade deals that liberals and labor unions fear could hurt American workers.

Clinton has not expressed her position but said trade deals should help workers and protect U.S. security.

Clinton said on Twitter that she welcomed Sanders to the race.

"I agree with Bernie. Focus must be on helping America's middle class," she wrote, saying Republicans would harm that group.

Sanders, a former Burlington, Vermont, mayor and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said he would campaign as an "independent Democrat," saying a third-party candidacy would be too expensive.

As an independent, Sanders belongs to neither the predominant Democratic or Republican parties. However, like fellow independent Senator Angus King of Maine, he attends Democratic strategy meetings in Congress.

He has cultivated a liberal following for defending expanding Social Security and raising taxes on the wealthy.

The Brooklyn native calls himself a "democratic socialist," and says voters know that is different from foreign leaders who call themselves socialists.

His entry could nudge Clinton to take more liberal positions. It could also give her cover against complaints that she will coast to the nomination untested.

Some could see Sanders as a substitute for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a darling of the left who has said she is not running. Erica Sagrans of Ready for Warren said in a statement the group was "excited" Sanders is running but wants Warren to jump in.

Similar pressure comes from former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who has not entered the race but has staked out liberal positions on issues such as trade.

Sanders' run is in line with a long Democratic tradition of insurgent liberal candidates challenging more mainstream hopefuls for the party presidential nomination.

President Barack Obama will go to a public library in one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods on Thursday to talk about a plan to give low-income children access to 10,000 e-books.

Working with publishers and libraries, the White House sees the modest plan as part of a strategy to address inner city problems by increasing educational opportunities for kids - woes brought into focus with recent riots in nearby Baltimore.

"If we're serious about living up to what our country is about, then we have to consider what we can do to provide opportunities in every community, not just when they're on the front page, but every day," said Jeff Zients, Obama's top economic adviser, in a briefing with reporters.

Zients cited research showing 80 percent of low-income children lag below their grade level in reading skills and lack books at home. The president will be visiting Anacostia Library in Southeast Washington, DC.
The plan includes $250 million in e-book commitments from publishers, including from the five major publishing houses: Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH's Macmillan, CBS Corp's Simon & Schuster Inc, Penguin Random House, Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group Inc, and News Corp's HarperCollins Publishers LLC.

The New York Public Library is developing an app to connect low-income kids with the books, and Obama will urge more communities to find ways to get kids into libraries.

Kids will need computers and devices to read the e-books. Zients noted the White House had previously announced programs to upgrade Internet services for schools and libraries, with private sector help from companies including Apple, which pledged $100 million in devices to low-income schools.

"It's very different than for our generation," said Cecilia Munoz, Obama's domestic policy adviser.

"More and more, you're going to be seeing kids using devices, and what we're doing is making sure that there's more books available on those devices," Munoz told reporters.

A House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, has received 4,000 pages of documents from the State Department's official inquiry into the attack, its chairman said on Thursday.

The documents are from the State Department's "Accountability Review Board" (ARB) investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012 attack that took the lives of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who heads the Select Committee on Benghazi, said in a statement it was the first time the proceedings of a State ARB had been turned over to Congress. He did not discuss their content, but said they would aid the panel's review of the attacks.

POLITICO, which earlier reported that the documents were handed over, said they include emails, internal memorandums and summaries of interviews, and have not been reviewed by other congressional committees investigating the incident that killed the four Americans.

Republicans say the State Department failed to protect diplomatic personnel at the time, when Hillary Clinton - now the presumptive Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential race - was secretary of state.

The ARB report, released in December 2012, did not find Clinton responsible for security lapses, but outlined widespread failings within her department.

The State Department has already turned over thousands of pages of other documents to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which was named last year. But Gowdy said Thursday he was still waiting for additional records.

He has said that Clinton's first appearance before the committee could occur in the week of May 18.

Democrats say the panel's efforts are politically motivated to undercut Clinton's presidential candidacy.

Gowdy's panel also is investigating Clinton's controversial use of a private email server rather than a government account while at the department.

In a letter reviewed by Reuters last week, the State Department said the committee had said its top priority was  collecting Clinton's emails about Benghazi.

Gowdy also said last week the committee's final report could be delayed until 2016, although he would prefer it done earlier.

A cache of Clinton's emails expected to be made public soon do not support Republican accusations that Clinton was involved in efforts to downplay the role of Islamic militants in the deadly attacks, two people familiar with the emails said this week.

U.S. President Barack Obama is unlikely to deliver his verdict on TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline between mid-June and mid-October for fear of being seen as interfering in Canada's upcoming election, said three Ottawa-based sources familiar with the matter.

Two of the sources said Obama - whose relations with Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper are generally cool - realized there was a risk that a decision before the election could be seen as a bid to influence the Oct. 19 vote.

"The announcement will not be made while Canada is focused on the election," said one of the sources.

Although the 36-day Canadian campaign is not officially due to kick off until Sept. 14, electioneering will start the day Parliament breaks for the summer on or about June 19.

There is historic precedent for Washington to be cautious. In 1963, when relations between President John F. Kennedy and Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker were poisonous, the United States accused Ottawa of not meeting its commitments to NATO.

The move triggered a crisis for the Conservatives and prompted Diefenbaker to call an election, which he lost. It is widely accepted in Canada that Washington had interfered.

Obama is under pressure from environmentalists to veto the northern leg of the pipeline, which would cross the border and carry crude from Canada's oil sands to U.S refineries. Obama has recently made critical comments about Keystone XL, which is strongly backed by Harper's government.

The election looks to be a race between the Conservatives and the opposition Liberals, who also back Keystone, and would most likely turn a veto by Obama into a campaign issue.

Thus any pre-election announcement by Obama seems unlikely, unless he were trying to send a message.

"Diplomatically, that would be very unwise," said a second source closely familiar with Canadian government thinking.

In Washington, the White House and the State Department declined to comment.

The Obama administration has taken six years to decide whether to approve the pipeline, prompting public complaints from Harper and other senior Canadian officials. Obama told Reuters on March 2 that a decision would be made “before the end of my administration, definitely.”

Andrew Cohen, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University and an expert on Kennedy, said he doubted Obama would make an announcement during the election, even though his relationship with Harper was not good.

"But it is at Diefenbakeresque levels? No, that was a hatred," he said.

President Barack Obama on Thursday said he would nominate Gayle Smith, a long-time White House adviser on development issues, as the next administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

"Gayle’s energy and passion have been instrumental in guiding America’s international development policy, responding to a record number of humanitarian crises worldwide, and ensuring that development remains at the forefront of the national security agenda," Obama said in a statement, urging the Senate to quickly confirm Smith to the position.

The mouse walked, the mouse stopped; the mouse ignored a bowl of food, then scampered back and gobbled it up, and it was all controlled by neuroscientists, researchers reported on Thursday.

The study, describing a way to manipulate a lab animal's brain circuitry accurately enough to turn behaviors both on and off, is the first to be published under President Barack Obama's 2013 BRAIN Initiative, which aims to advance neuroscience and develop therapies for brain disorders.

The point of the remote-control mouse is not to create an army of robo-rodents. Instead, neuroscientists hope to perfect a technique for identifying brain wiring underlying any behavior, and control that behavior by activating and deactivating neurons.

If scientists are able do that for the circuitry involved in psychiatric or neurological disorders, it may lead to therapies. That approach reflects a shift away from linking such illnesses to "chemical imbalances" in the brain, instead tracing them to miswiring and misfiring in neuronal circuits.

"This tool sharpens the cutting edge of research aimed at improving our understanding of brain circuit disorders, such as schizophrenia and addictive behaviors," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the $1 million study.

The technique used to control neurons is called DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs).

Brain neurons are genetically engineered to produce a custom-made - "designer" - receptor. When the receptor gathers in a manmade molecule that fits like a key in a lock, the neuron is activated.

Because the receptor does not respond to other molecules, including natural ones in the brain, the only way to activate the neurons is via the manmade one. DREADDs allow scientists to manipulate neurons without implanting anything in the brain.

DREADDs, invented about a decade ago, had been used to turn neurons on or off, but not both. DREADDs 2.0 are the first to do that, scientists led by Bryan Roth of the University of North Carolina reported in Neuron.

Targeting hunger-promoting neurons, the scientists made mice ignore food bowls or dive into them. Targeting movement neurons, they made mice scamper or stop.

In a competing remote-control technique called optogenetics, engineered neurons are activated upon receiving a pulse of light. That turns them on and off more quickly than with DREADDs, but the hardware required for delivering light to a spot in the brain is invasive and cumbersome.

New York state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Republican, and his son are expected to be arrested next week on federal corruption charges, The New York Times reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.

The criminal charges against Skelos, 67, and his son, Adam, 32, were expected to be detailed in a criminal complaint and likely will include conspiracy, extortion and solicitation of bribes, the newspaper quoted one source as saying.

The Times reported that the charges could be announced as early as Monday.

Investigators have been looking into the business dealings of Adam Skelos, including his hiring by an Arizona company that won a local government contract in New York although it was not the low bidder, and a $20,000 signing bonus from a title insurance company that never employed him, the Times said.

In question is whether the elder Skelos used his political influence to help the Arizona company, AbTech Industries, which won a $12 million storm-water treatment contract from Nassau County on Long Island, the senator's home district, the newspaper said.

Federal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York have been presenting evidence to a grand jury for several weeks, the newspaper reported.

Skelos, his attorney and a representative for the U.S. Attorney could not be immediately reached for comment.

New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was charged in January with pocketing $4 million from bribery and kickback schemes. He resigned as speaker after his arrest. Silver lost a bid last week to dismiss the federal corruption charges.

Both cases stem from a 2013 anti-corruption panel known as the Moreland Commission that was created and abruptly dismantled by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a move that triggered an investigation by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.

Bharara has castigated Albany for housing "one of the most corrupt governments in the nation" and said the concentration of power among the "three men in the room" - as Cuomo, Silver and Skelos were widely known - may be part of the problem.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Saudi Arabia and Paris this week to discuss Middle Eastern issues, a spokeswoman said on Monday.

Kerry will be in Riyadh on Wednesday and Thursday to meet with senior Saudi leaders to discuss regional security issues, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition conducting air strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

After Riyadh, Kerry will go to Paris to meet with foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council nations to discuss security and other regional issues. He also will take part in commemorations of the allied victory in World War Two and meet with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.

Kerry's visits to Riyadh and Paris will be part of a trip that already has taken him to Sri Lanka to strengthen ties with that country. He currently is in Kenya to discuss fighting the militant Islamist group al Shabaab, among other issues.

Former Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) Chief Executive Carly Fiorina on Monday announced she is running for president, and took a shot at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who she said represents a political class that Americans are "disgusted" with.

Once one of the most powerful women in American business, Fiorina registers near the bottom of polls of the dozen or so Republican hopefuls and has never held public office.

She is positioning herself as an outsider with real-life experience earned through years in the corporate world.

Fiorina, 60, said the former first lady and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, belong to an out-of-touch political elite.

"She reminds people that there is a huge disconnect between that political class and the hopes and concerns of hard-working Americans everywhere," she told reporters on a conference call.

"I see that disconnect everywhere I go. I see people just disgusted, honestly, with the way the playing field is tilted against them, the disconnect between what they're thinking about and what they perceive people in Washington are thinking about," Fiorina said.

A breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction, Fiorina is a multimillionaire who has known adversity.

She was forced to resign from HP in 2005 as the tech company struggled to digest a $19 billion merger with then-rival computer maker Compaq.
Around the time of her ouster from HP she was derisively dubbed the “anti-Steve Jobs” by one respected tech news website, though the Compaq merger was eventually seen as a success.

Fiorina is at the bottom of a Reuters/Ipsos online poll of actual and possible Republican White House candidates, with less than 1 percent support.

She has gotten a warm reception at events in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire but she suffered an

embarrassment on the first day of her campaign when a critic took over a website with her name in it to highlight job losses at HP.

Visitors to the carlyfiorina.org site saw the message, "Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard."

The site showed "sad-face" emoticons to symbolize what it said were 30,000 job losses at the company. Fiorina's real campaign web site, www.carlyforpresident.com, featured a video from her about the presidential bid and other messages.

In 2010, Fiorina lost the election for a U.S. Senate seat in California to Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, failing to benefit from a wave of pro-Republican sentiment nationally.

She said on Monday that her first phone call as president would be to the prime minister of Israel to assure the Jewish state of America's support.

The second call, she said, would be to the supreme leader of Iran to warn him of U.S. sanctions unless he allowed unfettered access for inspectors to Tehran's nuclear program.

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton defended his charitable foundation's acceptance of large foreign donations on Monday, thrusting himself into a controversy that is weighing on the presidential candidacy of his wife, Hillary Clinton.

"I don't think there's anything sinister in trying to get wealthy people in countries that are seriously involved in development to spend their money wisely in a way that helps poor people and lifts them up," Clinton told NBC News from Kenya, in an interview taped over the weekend.

His decision to emerge from the sidelines and speak out about the Clinton Foundation reflects concerns about getting Hillary Clinton's campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination back on a sound footing after it took a pounding in recent weeks.

The former first lady, also a previous secretary of state and former senator from New York, has attempted to present herself as a candidate who would fight for everyday Americans.

But her campaign has been on the defensive over questions about foreign donations to the family's charitable organization and whether her work as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state was influenced by the donations.

"There is no doubt in my mind that we have never done anything knowingly inappropriate in terms of taking money to influence any kind of American government policy," Clinton said. "That just hasn't happened."

Hillary Clinton faces only limited opposition in her drive for the nomination, but the drumbeat of criticism has taken a toll on her image.

An AP-GfK poll released Friday showed that among Democrats, only 34 percent said they were excited by her candidacy, while 36 percent were merely satisfied. Another 19 percent said they were neutral, and 9 percent were disappointed or angry.

America Rising, a Republican group that is seeking to derail Clinton's candidacy, unveiled a 60-second web video on Monday that seeks to raise more ethical questions about the Democrat.

The video uses Clinton's 2009 declaration that "there is not an inherent conflict of interest in any of my husband’s work," while also listing a variety of countries that have contributed to the foundation.

Scrutiny of the foundation has focused on foreign donations as well as on Bill Clinton.

A New York Times review of the organization two weeks ago found that Clinton had accepted a $500,000 speaking fee from Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin.

As has been customary for the Clintons over the years, the former president described the controversy as old news.

"There's been a very deliberate attempt to take the foundation down. And there's almost no new fact that wasn't known when she ran for president first time," Clinton said, referring to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign.

Clinton said he would continue making paid speeches while his wife is a candidate, saying: "I gotta pay the bills. And I also give a lot of it to the foundation every year.”

Still, he said he would consider stepping back from the foundation if she is elected to the White House in 2016.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to review the legality of an Obama administration regulation aimed at encouraging efficiency in the electricity market by having electrical grid operators pay users to reduce consumption at peak times.

The court said it will hear an appeal filed by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeking to reverse a May 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that threw out the rule. The regulation, aimed at improving grid reliability and encouraging clean energy, remains in effect as the litigation continues.

FERC chairman Norman Bay said in a statement that the program is "important to the nation's competitive wholesale electricity markets and reliable electric service."

The regulation concerns what FERC calls "demand-response," which is when, in an attempt to manage demand for electricity, regional electrical grid operators agree to pay electricity users to cut consumption at peak times.

The brief court order noted that Justice Samuel Alito will be recused in the case, meaning only eight justices will participate. The court did not give a reason.

The Electric Power Supply Association, other trade groups that represent utilities and PPL Corp challenged the regulation. They would lose out if the regulation is allowed to stay intact because it is likely to reduce demand for electricity generation.

Some utilities and companies like EnerNOC Inc that have developed products to help customers lower electricity usage had backed the government's appeal, as did companies like aluminum producer Alcoa Inc that can benefit from the payments.

Environmental groups also back the rule, saying it helps promote renewable energy sources and reduce air pollution by making the electricity market more flexible and limiting demand for electricity generation.

The case does not directly affect the Obama administration's separate plan to regulate carbon emissions from power plants.

The 2011 FERC order set the methodology that wholesalers had to use to calculate the compensation, saying it must be the same as the payments made to electricity generators.

The appeals court said FERC, as a federal agency, had no authority to do so because "demand-response" is an issue that should be dealt with by state regulators.

The Electric Power Supply Association's members include Exelon Corp and Dynegy Inc. Also challenging the regulation is utility group Edison Electric Institute, which represents such companies as Entergy Corp and Southern Company.

The court will hear arguments and rule on the matter in its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2016.

The two related cases are FERC v. Electric Power Supply Association, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-840 and EnerNOC Inc v. Energy Power Supply Association, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-841.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson told a Florida television station on Sunday that he is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

"I'm willing to be part of the equation and, therefore, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America," Carson said in an interview with CBS affiliate WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Carson, 63, who is popular with the conservative Tea Party movement, is expected to formally declare his candidacy at an event in Detroit on Monday.

He would be the first African-American to enter the growing Republican field for the party's presidential nomination next year.

“Many people have suggested to me that I should run for president, even though I’m not a politician,” said Carson, who has never before sought elective office.

The first doctor to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head, Carson developed a conservative following in 2013 after he advocated a flat tax, private medical savings accounts and other conservative policies at a National Prayer Breakfast speech that was attended by President Barack Obama.

Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have already entered the Republican presidential race.

Former Hewlett Packard Co Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina is expected to declare her candidacy in an online announcement on Monday. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will make an announcement on Tuesday about his plans. He also ran for the nomination in 2008.

Other potential Republican candidates include former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Among Democrats, former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is considered the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont entered the Democratic race last week.

Federal authorities charged New York state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos and his son on Monday with engaging in a corruption scheme, in the latest of a string of criminal cases against politicians in the state's capital of Albany.

Skelos, a 67-year-old Republican, and his 32-year-old son, Adam, were named in a six-count criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court that included charges of conspiracy and extortion.

Prosecutors said Skelos pressured a real estate developer and an environmental technology company to pay his son more than $200,000 in exchange for his support on infrastructure and legislation.

The men surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday morning. They were expected to later appear in court.

Skelos said in a statement he was "innocent of the charges leveled against me." His son's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

In the last decade, 22 legislators have been charged in Albany for corruption, according to New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice.

Then-New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was charged for corruption offenses in January. This is the first time in recent history that leaders of both of legislative chambers are simultaneously facing charges.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Skelos' case showed that "public corruption is a deep-seated problem" in New York.

Monday's complaint built upon evidence secured through cooperating witnesses, wire taps and search warrants.

According to the complaint, beginning in 2010, Skelos and his son pressured a real estate developer to pay Adam Skelos, a commissioned title insurance salesman, while the company was lobbying for legislation.

Payments included $20,000 disguised as a commission and $4,000 per month from an environmental technology firm tied to the developer seeking to win government-funded contracts, the complaint said.

Campaign finance records indicate the unnamed developer was Glenwood Management. Its lawyer declined to comment.

The complaint's description of the environmental company matched a subsidiary of Arizona-based AbTech Holdings Inc (ABHD.PK).

AbTech said on Monday it is cooperating with authorities.

In 2013 AbTech secured a $12 million stormwater systems project with New York's Nassau County. The complaint said while the contract was under consideration, Skelos and his son threatened to block it unless payments were increased, resulting in Adam Skelos receiving $10,000 per month.

By February, the company had paid Adam Skelos $198,000, the complaint said, while Dean Skelos took steps to help the company.

The U.S. Justice Department will begin disclosing more information about how law enforcement officials use secret cellphone tracking devices and is reviewing how the technology is deployed, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

The newspaper, quoting Justice Department officials, said senior officials had determined they must be more open about the way the devices are used and why, although there was no agreement about how much to disclose or how quickly.

Asked about the report, Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said: “With regard to this particular technology, the Department of Justice is in the process of examining its policies to ensure they reflect the department’s continuing commitment to conducting its vital missions while according appropriate respect for privacy and civil liberties.”

The Journal said the FBI had begun getting search warrants to use the technology that traces criminal suspects through their cellphones. For years, the bureau did not get such warrants, the paper added.

Inside the Justice Department, the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and Drug Enforcement Administration deploy the technology, the Journal said, with each agency having its own rules about how to use it.

The technology was created over a decade ago to help hunt militants and spies abroad. The Journal said many local police departments were now using it to track criminal suspects they are investigating.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson slammed "slick politicians" in both parties as he launched his bid on Monday for the 2016 Republican nomination for president, casting himself as a problem-solver whose experience sets him apart from the field.

Carson, a favorite of conservative activists, said the upcoming elections should bring in leaders with "common sense" to enact policies like reversing President Barack Obama's 2010 health care overhaul and revamping the U.S. tax code.

"I've got to tell you something. I'm not politically correct, and I'm probably never going to be politically correct because I'm not a politician," Carson said in a speech in Detroit, his hometown.

"Politicians do what is politically expedient, and I want to do what's right," he said.

Carson, who is 63 and the only black person currently seeking the nomination in either the Republican or Democratic parties, is a political neophyte. In polls of the Republican Party's wide field of likely candidates, he currently gets about 4.8 percent of the vote, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls.

That is well behind the leader, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has not formally declared his candidacy but is widely expected to do so in coming months.

Carson came from a poor family, raised by a single mother. He rose to be director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore at age 33 and successfully separated twins conjoined at the head. He became a conservative icon after the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he called the United States a nation in decay and criticized policies enacted by Obama, who sat nearby.

His words have sometimes gotten Carson in trouble. He once called Obama a "psychopath" and has made comments on gay marriage that infuriated the left.

On Monday, Carson played up his outsider status. He talked about his childhood in rough neighborhoods with rats and roaches and drug dealers who sometimes gave children candy.

He cited sacrifices his mother made to push his argument that safety-net programs cause government dependency instead of encouraging people to help themselves.

Carson also said his background as a surgeon and running a program that awards scholarships to students showed his ability to solve tough problems.

"I can name a lot of people in politics who have been there all their lives. You probably wouldn't want them to polish your shoe," he said. "We need to be smart enough to think for ourselves."

The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee has written President Barack Obama over concerns that a recently reported data breach on the White House computer system might have compromised the personal information of many Americans.

"Just like any entity that handles personally-identifiable information, the White House has a responsibility to notify Americans if the recent, or any future breach, results in a compromise,” the committee chairman, John Thune, said in a statement on Sunday accompanying the letter.

“If such information has been lost, the White House still has a responsibility to victims even if it believes the hack was perpetrated by foreign spies and not cyber thieves," Thune added.

The White House said last month that a CNN report that Russian hackers penetrated sensitive parts of the White House computer system referred to an incident it disclosed last year, and declined to comment on who was responsible for the breach.

It added that it took immediate measures at the time to evaluate and mitigate the activity.

Asked about the Commerce Committee letter, White House National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh declined to comment further on the breach, but said: "We have consistently supported timely notification in the event of data breaches, consistent with existing federal policy."

Thune in his letter to Obama said that while hackers did not appear to have accessed classified data, the unclassified computer system reportedly contained sensitive information such as schedules, policy discussions and emails, including exchanges with diplomats.

"This unclassified computer system likely also contains the personally identifiable information of many Americans," the South Dakota Republican wrote, noting that people must submit personal information before being allowed to enter the White House.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner challenged Hillary Clinton on Sunday to help the White House get trade legislation through the U.S. Congress by speaking out in favor of it.

Lawmakers are debating whether to give President Barack Obama "fast-track" authority to negotiate deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trade is a rare issue on which the White House enjoys support from Republicans, but many Democrats are opposed.

"She can't sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind here," Boehner said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Boehner said Clinton, 2016 presidential contender and a former secretary of state, supports both fast-track authority and the TPP, but "she just won't say so."

The White House says free-trade deals open up new markets to U.S. exports and help businesses compete abroad. But many Democrats and their supporters, including labor unions, say the deals help big corporations at the expense of American jobs.

Clinton has not stated a clear position on either fast-track legislation or the negotiation of the TPP deal with Asia. She recently said that any trade deal "has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security."

Representative James Clyburn, a member of House Democratic leadership, said this week he didn't know whether there were even 20 votes out of a total of 188 Democrats in the House for fast-track authority, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).

"The fact is that the president needs her help in order to get Democrat votes in the House and Senate to get this passed," Boehner said on Sunday.

There are 244 Republicans in the House, but not all of them support trade deals; Boehner's allies estimate that he may be only able to get 180 to 200 Republican votes for TPA.

Boehner told NBC that every Democratic leader in Congress is opposed to the president's position.

"We've got the majority here in the House and the Senate, but we can't do this by ourselves," Boehner said of the Republicans.

Clinton has also been criticized by Republican Jeb Bush, a potential presidential candidate, for her reticence on trade.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson told a Florida television station on Sunday that he is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

"I'm willing to be part of the equation and, therefore, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America," Carson said in an interview with CBS affiliate WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Carson, 63, who is popular with the conservative Tea Party movement, is expected to formally declare his candidacy at an event in Detroit on Monday.

He would be the first African-American to enter the growing Republican field for the party's presidential nomination next year.

“Many people have suggested to me that I should run for president, even though I’m not a politician,” said Carson, who has never before sought elective office.

The first doctor to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head, Carson developed a conservative following in 2013 after he advocated a flat tax, private medical savings accounts and other conservative policies at a National Prayer Breakfast speech that was attended by President Barack Obama.

Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have already entered the Republican presidential race.

Former Hewlett Packard Co Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina is expected to declare her candidacy in an online announcement on Monday. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will make an announcement on Tuesday about his plans. He also ran for the nomination in 2008.

Other potential Republican candidates include former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Among Democrats, former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is considered the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont entered the Democratic race last week.

Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner challenged Hillary Clinton on Sunday to help the White House get trade legislation through the U.S. Congress by speaking out in favor of it.

Lawmakers are debating whether to give President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Trade is a rare issue on which the White House enjoys support from Republicans, but many Democrats are opposed.

"She can't sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind here," Boehner said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Boehner said that Clinton, 2016 presidential contender and a former secretary of state, supports both fast-track authority and the TPP, but "she just won't say so."

There are 244 Republicans in the House, but not all of them support trade deals. Boehner's allies estimate that he may be only able to get 180 to 200 Republican votes for TPA.

Republican Senator Jeff Sessions expressed concerns on Sunday about TPA, including the strengthening of presidential power over trade at the expense of Congress and the risk of currency manipulation and increased trade deficits and immigration.

"Perhaps we don't need a fast-track, but a regular track: where the President sends us any proposal he deems worthy and we review it on its own merits," the Alabama lawmaker said in a statement.

U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski said on Thursday she will unveil a bill next week that would reverse the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports.

Murkowski, the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she would unveil the bill on Tuesday, although it was uncertain when the measure would get a vote in her committee. Murkowski has been one of the biggest supporters of reversing the ban Congress passed in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo led to fears of energy shortages.

Congress' failure to even debate U.S. military action against Islamic State nine months after air strikes began is cowardly and shameful as Americans fight an undeclared war, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine said on Thursday.

Kaine, a Democratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been a steady critic of Congress' failure to authorize military force against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq despite a U.S.-led bombing campaign that began Aug. 8.

In a U.S. Senate speech to mark the beginning of the 10th month of the military campaign, Kaine lambasted Congress for its inaction.

"The silence of Congress in the midst of this war is cowardly and shameful," Kaine said.

The United States has lost American service members, spent more than $2 billion, and conducted more than 3,000 bombing runs without Congress even talking about authorizing military action, he said.

"How can we explain to our troops, our public or ourselves this complete unwillingness of Congress to take up this important responsibility?" Kaine said in the speech.

President Barack Obama asked Congress in February to authorize the use of military force (AUMF) against Islamic State after agitation from lawmakers who were worried that the military campaign overstepped his constitutional authority.

But the request has made little progress.

Obama's fellow Democrats worry about getting involved in another Middle East war, while the Republicans who control Congress want stronger measures than those Obama has proposed.

House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said last month Obama's proposal did not have enough support to pass.

Kaine questioned why Congress "allows an executive war to go on undeclared, unapproved, undefined and unchecked" and said lawmakers are either indifferent or "lack the backbone" to do their job.

The state of Massachusetts on Thursday defended a 1946 law making it illegal to tell lies about candidates for office, after a woman facing possible jail time for a mailer about a Cape Cod candidate challenged the measure's constitutionality.

The legal fight dates back to 2014 when a Democratic state representative filed a criminal complaint against a woman who worked for a Republican-leaning super political action committee (PAC), charging that the PAC lied about him in a campaign brochure.

The state law makes it illegal to knowingly make "any false statement" against a candidate for public office that seeks to influence the election's outcome.

A lawyer for the woman, Melissa Lucas, argued in the state's top court that the law is too vague and broad, and violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech.

Peter Charles Horstmann, who represents Lucas, contended that "the truth doesn't die because of a false statement," but is imperiled when someone fears speaking up because of the threat of being taken to court.

Assistant Attorney General Amy Spector countered that the law is necessary to stop "the kind of fraud that is designed to trick voters."

Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Grants mused that the law itself could become a tool used in political campaigns.

"Isn't it itself a weapon in a campaign?," Grants asked during arguments on Thursday.

In 2014, State Representative Brian Mannal invoked the law to file two criminal complaints against Lucas, for contending in campaign brochures that Mannal would financially benefit from his proposed legislation to give sex offenders’ better access to lawyers.

Lucas' arraignment has been stayed until the Supreme Judicial Court's decision. The state Attorney General's Office argued the complaints against Lucas should be dismissed regardless of the court's findings about the constitutionality of the law, since it believes her statements were opinions, not facts.

The American Civil Liberties Union and local civil rights groups have submitted amicus briefs supporting Lucas' contention that the law is unconstitutional.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday he would create a so-called Wage Board, a move apparently designed to allow him to raise the minimum wage without the approval of state lawmakers.

Cuomo in his January budget recommended raising the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour in New York City and $10.50 elsewhere in the state, only to see that proposal rejected by the state legislature.

But Cuomo, a Democrat, wrote in an editorial in the New York Times that state law allowed him to independently impanel a Wage Board to determine what adequate pay should be across the state.

"On Thursday, I am directing the commissioner to impanel such a board, to examine the minimum wage in the fast-food industry," Cuomo said in the editorial. "The board will return in about three months with its recommendations, which do not require legislative approval."

Cuomo said the Wage Board could "set fast-food workers on a path out of poverty" as well as ease the financial burden on taxpayers and create a new national standard.

"Some argue that we can close the income gap by pulling down the top," he wrote. "I believe we should do it by lifting up the bottom. We can begin by raising labor standards, starting with the minimum wage."

Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania told Fox News on Wednesday he will announce on May 27 whether he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Santorum's website said "a special announcement" would be made in Pittsburgh on the evening of May 27.

If he enters the race, Santorum would join a field that so far includes Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida; former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee; former Hewlett-Packard Co chief Carly Fiorina; and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Calling Republican defense spending plans a "road to nowhere," Defense Secretary Ash Carter appealed on Wednesday for lawmakers to work with him toward a new bipartisan budget deal to provide stable funding for a U.S. military hurt by years of steep cuts.

Carter told a Senate appropriations panel that Republican efforts to try to meet President Barack Obama's defense funding request were well-intentioned but would not give the Pentagon the flexibility it needed and ultimately would lock in budget cuts Obama has threatened to veto.

The president proposed a $534 billion Pentagon base budget for the 2016 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that exceeds federal spending caps by $35 billion and could trigger mandatory cuts. Obama also sought $51 billion in funding for conflicts overseas in an account not covered by the spending caps.

The Republican-controlled Congress, which opposes many of Obama's spending priorities, is considering a $499 billion Pentagon base budget that would not exceed spending caps. But it is studying $90 billion in war funding, $39 billion more than requested, to make up for cuts in the base budget.

"While this approach clearly recognizes that the budget total we’ve requested is needed, the avenue it takes is just as clearly a road to nowhere," Carter told the appropriations panel, noting that Obama has threatened to veto a budget that locks in current spending caps.

If that happens, Carter said, the Pentagon would be facing another autumn of budget uncertainty when it is unable to plan effectively and has to make the kind of "hasty and drastic" decisions it has had to make over the past few years.

Those decisions have forced the military to make quick, short-term cuts from accounts for readiness, training and modernization, leaving the force increasingly unbalanced.

Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the panel the cuts have put the United States in a position where "our global aspirations are exceeding our available resources."

Carter said if Congress continued to push ahead with the Republican plans rather than exploring other alternatives he feared "we'll all be left holding the bag."

Congress and the president have directed the Pentagon to cut about a trillion dollars in planned defense spending over a decade.

The reductions come as the U.S. military is trying to modernize aging weapons while coping with threats unforeseen just three years ago, including the rise of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and Russia's involvement in Ukraine.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner's plan to slash healthcare spending in the upcoming state budget failed to attract a single affirmative vote in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday.

The bill amendment was the first major piece of the Republican governor's $32 billion, fiscal 2016 general funds budget, which relies on $6.6 billion in spending cuts, to come up for a legislative vote.

The human services budget totaling $11.1 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease from current appropriations, failed in a 0-67 vote.

Republican legislators voted "present" to protest the fact the amendment was not vetted by appropriate House committees and was instead sent directly to the chamber's floor by powerful Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. Madigan said he offered the legislation to facilitate legislative consideration of the governor's budget.

State Representative Greg Harris, a Democrat, said committees have heard hours of testimony from social service agencies and others since Rauner unveiled his budget in February.

"It is not a mystery what is in this bill," Harris said.

House Democrats subsequently passed a bill amendment that restores funding to some programs, as Republicans continued to vote "present." Votes on more amendments were expected to follow.

Rauner's office said there was no time for "political stunts."

"Governor Rauner stands ready to work with Democrats to pass real structural changes to our government and enact a balanced budget," his office said in a statement. "Rather than engaging in political theater, we ask Democrats to meet the governor at the negotiating table and help turn our state around."

The state's fiscal year begins on July 1 and budget bills will require a three-fifths legislative vote after May 31. Rauner has ruled out any revenue increases without reforms that include right-to-work zones, a local property tax freeze, pension cuts, and legislative term limits.

Illinois has a chronic structural budget deficit, as well as the lowest credit ratings and worst-funded pension system among the 50 states. The fiscal crisis is the most severe the state has seen in decades, according to budget experts. Rauner has said reforms must precede new revenue.

A $26 million cut in the current state budget to social service programs ordered by Rauner in April was reversed after a groundswell of protests.

Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat fond of hardball politics who quit as U.S. House of Representatives speaker amid accusations of financial impropriety and decried the "mindless cannibalism" of his colleagues, died on Wednesday at age 92.

Wright, who held the House's top post from 1987 to 1989 after succeeding Washington legislative heavyweight Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, died at a nursing home in Fort Worth, Texas, according to a local funeral home.

Known for his bushy eyebrows and bursts of temper, he was elected to the House in 1954 and served for 34 years before becoming the first speaker to resign midterm amid allegations of wrongdoing.

"He was a committed public leader and a proud World War II veteran who dedicated much of his life to serving his country," President Barack Obama said.

Current House leaders praised Wright. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called him "a person of deep courage, brilliant eloquence and complete mastery of the legislative process." Republican Speaker John Boehner lauded Wright's "lifelong commitment to public service."

Wright was speaker for 29 months before resigning from Congress after a yearlong investigation that left him facing likely conviction in the House on charges that his financial dealings violated the chamber's rules.

"All of us in both political parties must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism to an end," Wright told House colleagues in his resignation speech on May 31, 1989.

The House ethics committee found Wright had taken $145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth developer, including an $18,000-a-year salary for his wife, Betty, for which she did no actual work as well as the use of a condominium and Cadillac.

Wright called the allegations politically motivated, insisting he and his wife did nothing wrong and abided by House rules, but decided to quit to spare the House further trauma.

"I don't want to be a party to tearing up the institution. I love it," Wright said in his resignation speech, saying Congress had become a place where "vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication."

Wright's downfall represented an early manifestation of the hyper-partisanship that grew in subsequent decades, often condemning Washington to partisan gridlock and dysfunction.

'AN INSULT'

As speaker, Wright amassed power and influence over legislation in a way that inspired growing resentment from minority Republicans.

At the time, Democrats controlled the House and Senate during the presidencies of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Republican Congressman Newt Gingrich, beginning his ascendancy in the House, seized upon an independent watchdog group's report to accuse Wright of unethical conduct, formally asking the ethics committee to investigate.

Gingrich called Wright's resignation speech "an insult to the ethics committee and an insult to institutional decency."

Gingrich served as speaker from 1995 to 1999. In 1997, he became the first speaker disciplined for ethical wrongdoing when his colleagues voted to reprimand him and fine him $300,000 for using tax-exempt money to promote Republican goals and giving the House ethics panel false information.

James Claude Wright Jr. was born in Fort Worth on Dec. 22, 1922. He earned a Distinguished Flying Cross while flying South Pacific combat missions in B-24 Liberators during World War Two.

Wright was elected to the Texas legislature at age 23. Three years later he became mayor of Weatherford, his boyhood home. In 1954, the ambitious Wright challenged and beat an incumbent Democrat in his race for the U.S. House. He became the No. 2 House Democrat in 1976.

Wright was considered more moderate than many of his white Southern colleagues and supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that guaranteed voting rights to black Americans.

President Barack Obama is expected to make a renewed U.S. push next week to help Gulf allies create a region-wide defense system to guard against Iranian missiles as he seeks to allay their anxieties over any nuclear deal with Tehran, according to U.S. sources.

The offer could be accompanied by enhanced security commitments, new arms sales and more joint military exercises, U.S. officials say, as Obama tries to reassure Gulf Arab countries that Washington is not abandoning them.

With little more than a week to go before Obama hosts the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council at the White House and then at Camp David, aides are discussing the options in pre-summit meetings with Arab diplomats. Officials say no final decisions on possible U.S. proposals have been made.

    Obama faces a formidable challenge in deciding how far to go to sell skeptical Sunni-led allies on his top foreign policy priority, a final nuclear deal with Shi’ite Iran due by a June 30 deadline. Failure to placate them could further strain ties, though additional defense obligations would carry the risk of the United States being drawn into new Middle East conflicts.

    Obama issued the invitation to the GCC after Iran and six world powers reached a framework agreement last month that would give Tehran sanctions relief for reining in its nuclear program.

Gulf Arab neighbors, including key U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, worry that Iran will not be deterred from a nuclear bomb and will be flush with cash from unfrozen assets to fund proxies and expand its influence in countries such as Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.

U.S. officials with knowledge of the internal discussions concede that Obama is under pressure to calm Arab fears by offering strengthened commitments.

“It’s a time to see what things might be required to be formalized,” a senior U.S. official said.

Obama is all but certain to stop short of a full security treaty with Saudi Arabia or other Gulf nations as that would require approval by the Republican-controlled Senate and risk stoking tensions with Washington's main Middle East ally Israel.

"TWO-WAY STREET"

A second U.S. official insisted the summit would be a “two-way street,” with Washington pushing Gulf leaders to overcome internal rivalries and find ways to collaborate better in their own defense.

Obama is likely to press Gulf allies to do more to integrate their disparate militaries and work toward a long-delayed anti-missile shield against an Iranian ballistic missile threat, the sources familiar with the discussions said. This could take the form of a new high-level joint working group led by the Pentagon, one of the sources said.

    Gulf countries have already bought U.S. missile defense systems such as the Patriot system built by Raytheon Co and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system built by Lockheed Martin Corp.

But the Obama administration is now expected to press them to implement the initiative touted in late 2013 by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.

The program allows the GCC to purchase equipment as a bloc and start knitting together radars, sensors and early warning networks with U.S. assistance, but has been held up by distrust among some of the Gulf monarchies.

The Obama administration is concerned about shortcomings in the Gulf states’ joint operational capacity exposed by a Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen that has failed to push back Iran-allied Houthi fighters.

    It was unclear specifically what Washington would offer the Gulf nations - which already operate some of the most advanced U.S.-made weaponry - in order to advance the missile shield. Lingering rifts between GCC members, especially Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, would need to be put aside before a joint missile system would be viable.

    Experts now believe the time is ripe for greater cooperation because of deteriorating security across the region.

    “Missile defense is absolutely critical to the GCC right now,” said Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. “They’re not as efficient playing separately as they would be all playing as one team,” he said.

Wary that Obama might keep any new security pledges vague, Gulf states have also made clear they want this translated into concrete steps.

“This summit can’t just be a big photo-op to pretend everybody’s on the same page on Iran,” one Arab diplomat said.

    Several arms sales are likely, including resupplying bombs and missiles depleted in the Saudi-led air assault in Yemen and in strikes against Islamic State militants in the U.S.-led air campaign in Syria, the sources close to the matter said.

But Washington is widely expected to stand firm on its decision for now to withhold sales of Lockheed’s new top-flight F-35 fighter jet, which has been promised to Israel to help maintain a long-standing U.S. commitment to its regional military superiority.

A former mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, who served seven years in prison after being convicted of racketeering and bribery charges kicked off a campaign on Wednesday to win back the office he last held 12 years ago.

Democrat Joseph Ganim had been viewed as a rising political star and possible gubernatorial or congressional contender when he was arrested and charged with running a "pay-to-play" operation in which real estate developers had to pay bribes to win deals in Connecticut's largest city.

Ganim, 55, said on Wednesday he had filed papers to challenge Democratic Mayor Bill Finch. He contended that he was the best candidate for the job he held from 1991 through 2003, when he was convicted.

"Bridgeport deserves a mayor focused on creating jobs, lowering taxes, improving schools, revitalizing neighborhoods, and creating a Bridgeport that works for everyone," Ganim said in a statement, in which he also admitted to making "serious errors of judgment."

Since an early prison release in 2010, Ganim has worked as a legal assistant at his family's law firm, but has been unsuccessful in having his law license restored.

Finch and his campaign team blasted Ganim on Wednesday.

"Joe Ganim is a corrupt politician who spent seven years in prison. His criminal activity has already cost the people of Bridgeport more than a hundred million dollars," Finch's campaign manager, Maryli Secrest, said. "Ganim's failed investment scheme and sweetheart investment deal on the waterfront set us back years."

Ganim's run comes after Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, a two-time convicted felon who was mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, for more than two decades, lost his bid last November to regain the mayoralty.

The U.S. State Department has deemed it "not acceptable" for staff to conduct official business on a private email server as presidential contender Hillary Clinton did when she was secretary of state, a senior department official told senators on Wednesday.

Testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Joyce Barr, the State Department's assistant secretary of administration, said that, in the course of recovering Clinton's emails, the agency had clarified its guidelines on record keeping.

Asked by Republican Senator Thom Tillis if the practices used by Clinton were still acceptable at the department, Barr said, "We continue to do training but we've sent department notices, telegrams, we've talked to directors. I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable."

Asked to clarify whether she meant it was both unacceptable now and should have been unacceptable in the past, Barr said, "Going forward, yes."

Clinton is the leading contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2016. She is expected to testify soon before a U.S. House of Representatives panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and to answer questions about her email practices.

Clinton’s exclusive use of a personal email account for government business as secretary of state emerged in a New York Times report in March that prompted concerns about transparency and security.

Clinton explained that she thought it would be simpler to just have one account so she would only need to carry one email handheld device. She has also said that while she should have used a separate government email account, she violated no rules.

Barr told senators on the Republican-controlled committee on Wednesday that the State Department now has all of the official emails that Clinton had turned over to the department but was relying on her word that nothing official was withheld.

Under questioning from Republican Senator John Cornyn, she said she had not known that Clinton was operating exclusively on a private email server while Clinton was secretary of state, nor was Barr aware of anyone else in the government who was now operating that way.

Senator Tillis said it was a "bad decision" on Clinton's part to use a private server and for the State Department to allow it.

"I hope that we go so far as to say if you do this in the future, you get fired," said the freshman senator.

Former President Bill Clinton acknowledged on Wednesday that an anti-crime crackdown he pushed in 1994 went too far, and said he now supports his wife Hillary's plans to reverse some of those justice policies.

Bill Clinton signed into law a crime bill that imposed tougher sentences, put thousands of more police on the streets and helped fund the building of extra prisons.

But the era of mass incarceration is now being questioned because of the continuing high proportion of Americans - especially black males - who are in prison.

The anti-crime legislation was known for its federal "three strikes" provision that sent violent offenders to prison for life. The bill was backed by congressional Republicans and hailed at the time as a success for Clinton.

But the former president told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that it was imperfect.

"The problem is the way it was written and implemented. We have too wide a net. We have too many people in prison. And we wound up spending - putting so many people in prison that there wasn’t enough money left to educate them, train them for new jobs and increase the chances when they came out that they could live productive lives," he said, according to a CNN transcript of the interview.

Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has criticized mass incarceration, launching an effort last week to reform the criminal justice system and cut sentences in the wake of the Baltimore riots.

Asked by CNN whether he agreed with his wife moving away from his policy, Clinton replied: "Oh, absolutely," according to the transcript.

Clinton also said foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation charity did not affect U.S. foreign policy when Hillary was secretary of state between 2009 and 2013.

"We had a policy when she was secretary of state that we would only continue accepting money from people who were already giving us money," he said.

Bill Clinton said on Monday he may consider stepping down or taking less of an executive role at the Clinton Foundation should his wife become president.

The Clintons' political opponents have criticized the foundation for accepting funding from foreign governments for its endowment and for its charitable work abroad.

Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis said on Wednesday he will seek the Senate seat held by Marco Rubio, who is forgoing a re-election bid to run for the Republican presidential nomination.

DeSantis, a conservative from North Florida who is in his second term in the House of Representatives, pledged to campaign on policies limiting the role of government.

"America needs a new generation of leaders to address the big issues facing the country: alleviating the middle-class squeeze and promoting economic opportunity, confronting the significant national security challenges threatening the safety of our people, and reforming the culture of Washington, D.C.," he said in a statement announcing his candidacy.

The open U.S. Senate seat in Florida, the largest of the "swing states" that go back and forth between the major parties in presidential elections, could see one of the most hotly contested congressional elections in 2016.

Several prominent state Republicans have ruled out running for the Senate seat in a presidential year, which typically sees higher turnout among state Democratic voters.

Democratic U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy from southeast Florida is running, with wide support from his party's leaders.

The Florida Democratic Party immediately launched a fake campaign website, calling DeSantis "For the Tea Party, Not You."

His candidacy was quickly endorsed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, which noted that its political action committee has helped to elect high-profile conservatives, including Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rubio.

"He's a strong conservative, he has grassroots support, and he can win," the group said in a statement.

DeSantis, 36, stresses in his biography that he worked odd jobs to put himself through Yale University, then earned his law degree from Harvard Law School.

He has worked as a federal and military prosecutor and served in the U.S. Navy, deploying to Iraq in 2007 as an adviser, according to the biography on his campaign website.

He is a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve.

DeSantis lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, near Jacksonville.

The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is pushing ahead with a bill to ease rules across sections of the financial industry after the first round of efforts to work with his Democratic counterpart failed.

Alabama Republican Richard Shelby is crafting a regulatory relief bill that aims to give small U.S. banks more breathing room to operate by exempting them from certain federal regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.

The bill could also seek to ease regulations on regional banks such as Comerica Inc and insurers such as Allstate Corp and curb the authority of the Federal Reserve.

Some of the financial regulations targeted by Shelby were put in place as part of the 2010 Wall Street reform act known as Dodd-Frank.

Shelby wants one comprehensive bill to bring to the Senate floor, but the committee's top Democrat, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is resisting, according to people familiar with the matter, preferring a more targeted approach.

The Shelby camp held more than 30 meetings and calls on issues related to the bill with Brown's staff, according to a Republican aide who did not want to be identified.

"We have not met in two weeks because our previous meetings over the past month have been unproductive and we have begun the process of drafting," the Republican aide said an email to Reuters.

The split means Shelby can limit the bill's scope to get Brown's support or seek out more moderate Democrats. Shelby can also forego bipartisan support, and widen the bill's reach, knowing it will be well received by the financial industry but fail to get the kind of votes needed to push it forward.

Republicans control 54 votes in the Senate, short of the 60 needed to overcome procedural hurdles.

A mark-up is scheduled on May 14, meaning Shelby will have to send a draft of the bill to Brown soon, if they hold to the date.

Brown has said he wants a bill that would help small lenders but not trickle up to larger banks.

"Democrats are ready, willing, and able to provide regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions," Brown said in a statement. Shelby declined to comment.

Committee hearings since February showed other targets of the bill could include limiting the Federal Reserve's emergency lending abilities, changing the election process of the New York Fed President, and raising certain thresholds for bank regulations.

A Republican prosecutor declared victory on Tuesday night in a special election to replace disgraced U.S. Representative Michael Grimm, a month before his sentencing for federal tax evasion.

Unofficial New York City Board of Elections results showed Staten Island District Attorney Dan Donovan ahead of Democrat Vincent Gentile by about 8,000 votes, holding a lead of 59 percent to 39 percent.

"I want to thank you, the voters, for placing your faith in me to serve as your Congressman!" Donovan said in a statement on his Facebook account late on Tuesday. "I truly believe our nation is at a crossroads, but with that comes great opportunity."

Gentile, a member of the New York City Council and former state senator, could not be immediately reached for comment.

Donovan drew national attention last year for presenting evidence to a grand jury that did not indict a white police officer in the choking death of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, during an attempted arrest.

The district, which encompasses the borough of Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, is New York City's only Republican-leaning congressional district.

Grimm, a Republican elected to a third term while under federal indictment, resigned on Jan. 5. He pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges related to a Manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned, Healthalicious, and faces up to three years in prison at his June 8 sentencing.

A former FBI agent once considered a rising political star, Grimm was caught on camera last year threatening a reporter questioning him about an investigation into his campaign funds.

He told NY1 television reporter Michael Scotto: "I'll break you in half. Like a boy."

The U.S. Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a Republican budget plan that prescribes deep domestic spending cuts to eliminate deficits by 2024 and aids the party's goal of trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.

The first combined House-Senate budget in six years passed 51-48 with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans voting against it, presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

Senator David Vitter, a Republican who is running for Louisiana governor this year, did not cast a vote.

The non-binding resolution does not go to Obama's desk to be signed into law. Instead, it helps guide Congress' consideration of government agency spending bills and serves as a Republican fiscal policy manifesto that will influence 2016 election campaigns.

The blueprint would slash spending on the social safety net, education, infrastructure and other domestic programs by $5.3 trillion over 10 years with no tax increases. At the same time, it boosts defense spending next year by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war operations account.

Senate Republicans hailed it as the first balanced budget plan since a 2001 surplus, hoping to score points among voters worried about mounting U.S. debt levels.

"American families know they can’t live on borrowed money, and neither can the federal government," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi. "This balanced budget shows these families that if they can do it, so can we."

But most of the prescribed cuts will be ignored, as the new budget plan does not instruct congressional committees to implement them. Instead, the "reconciliation" instructions are focused on easing the way to repealing the Affordable Care Act.

These provisions will allow Republicans to use procedural tools to pass such legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than a near-impossible 60-vote threshold that would otherwise be needed.

While Obama is certain to veto any Republican bill to repeal his biggest domestic policy achievement, he may be more willing to compromise on changes to "Obamacare" if the U.S. Supreme Court in June strikes down the law's health insurance subsidy mechanism in many states.

In debate on Tuesday, Democrats played up the hardships that would result from the budget's deep cuts to food stamps and healthcare for the poor, as well as college tuition grants.

"That's what they want to run on? Be my guest," said Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, referring to the 24 Republican senators seeking re-election in 2016

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Tuesday for undocumented immigrants to be allowed to gain U.S. citizenship, courting Latino voters and drawing a line between herself and Republican rivals for the White House in 2016.

"We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship. Now, this is where I differ from everybody on the Republican side," Clinton told a group of students at a high school in Nevada.

The Latino vote is likely to be crucial in the 2016 election, especially in potential swing states such as Nevada and Colorado. Republicans are seeking to win a bigger slice of the Latino vote than in 2012 when they were perceived by many Hispanics as being too tough on illegal immigration

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican who is weighing a White House bid, has proposed legal status for the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants that falls short of full citizenship, although he has not ruled out some way for them to become Americans eventually.

Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election, said Republicans were offering "second-class status."

"When they talk about legal status, that is code for

second-class status and we should never forget who this debate is about," she said at Rancho High School.

The school is approximately 70 percent Hispanic and less than 10 miles north of the Las Vegas strip of casinos, a magnet for workers from all over the world.

Another potential Clinton rival, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, played a prominent role in drafting a broad immigration bill in 2013 that ultimately failed in Congress.

The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has since backed off a comprehensive reform effort in favor of a more piecemeal approach.

Clinton said her immigration reform policy would ensure that illegal immigrants who paid a fine, learned English and got in line could earn U.S. citizenship without risk of being deported.

She pledged to preserve and expand executive action on immigration by President Barack Obama, who let millions of undocumented immigrants stay in the United States legally and get work permits.

"If Congress continues to refuse to act, as president I would do everything possible under the law to go even further," she said.

Clinton said she wanted both "Dreamers" - children who were brought to the United States illegally by their families - and their parents to be allowed to stay legally in America.

Students at the school applauded and shouted "Yes," when the former first lady made a point they agreed with. Nevada hosts one of the earliest Democratic nominating contests next year and it will be a key test of Clinton's ability to win over Hispanics and other voters.
