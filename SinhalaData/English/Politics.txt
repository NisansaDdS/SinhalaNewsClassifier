Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe says that it is unfair to question the citizenship of Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.

Responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament today, Wickremesinghe stated that the reason for Mr Mahendran leaving the country was due to the action of the Rajapaksa regime.

Tension prevailed within the chambers during the Prime Minister’s response as opposition MPs raised their voice in objection to his comments and UNP MPs defended their party leader.

However, continuing his statement, Wickremesinghe stated that had Mr Mahendran not left the country in that manner he would have suffered the same fate of Lasantha Wickrematunge, the slain editor of the Sunday Leader.

He further said that raising questions regarding citizenship was unfair, when top posts such as Defence Secretary were held by American citizens during the rule of the previous administration.

The Prime Minister pointed out that his government would work towards the dawning of an era where those serving the country will be brought down as opposed to a policy of making them leave the country.

He said that MPs such as Dinesh Gunawardena should be happy that today they have the opportunity to even talk freely as those who spoke out during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s reign were silenced.
